  "title": "A Note for Instructors",
  "body": " A Note for Instructors  Math for the People is designed to be used for an introductory college-level course in quantitative reasoning, with an emphasis on social justice. Unlike a traditional mathematics textbook, the text is organized by social justice topics, with each module teaching the mathematics concepts needed to understand and work for change in a particular social justice area.  Each module is designed to be independent, although there may be overlap. Instructors are encouraged to proceed through the modules in the order that they find suitable, or to choose modules in consultation with their students. Each module is designed to be completed in approximately two weeks of a standard 16-week semester, or one week of an 8-week quarter (6-8 class contact hours).  Each module is structured identically, beginning with introductory material about the social justice topic and a discussion of the parameters of the problem being discussed. Once students have a fundamental understanding of the topic, the module introduces them to mathematical skills which they can use to analyze the problem. Finally, each module culminates in a section which encourages students to use their mathematical skills to engage with the social justice topic.  Because the topics which we are discussing in this class can be emotionally charged and \"political,\" we encourage faculty to plan for this in advance. The University of Waterloo offers a comprehensive set of tips for facilitating discussion of difficult topics (Facilitating Effective Discussions. Centre for Teaching Excellence, University of Waterloo, CC-BY-NC-4.0 ), some of which are summarized below:   Establish ground rules for discussion. A suggested set of ground rules is provided in . You can ask the class if they have other rules they would like to add.  Encourage students to participate in multiple different ways, including verbal, written, and electronic participation. Some students may need more time to collect their thoughts for sharing.  Actively work to include all students in the discussion. Don't allow one or two students to dominate the conversation or discourage contradiction.  Group students and ask them to focus in one part of the issue and report back to the whole class. Sharing ideas with a small group can be more comfortable initially.  Be comfortable with silence. Long pauses are a natural part of discussion on difficult topics - if you fill the space too quickly, it can discourage active discussion.  Limit your own involvement. You can correct misinformation or enforce group rules, but the point of a discussion is to hear & value student input.   Instructors who use the textbook are encouraged to fill out the Math for the People Instructor's Feedback Form or to join our Hypothes.is group . Hypothes.is is an online annotation tool which allows you to make private annotations on public webpages. Once you create an account and join our group, you can install a browser plugin which will allow you to make comments directly on the textbook webpage. Those comments will be visible to anyone with access to the hypothes.is group.  "

  "body": " A Note for Students  This textbook is intended to guide you through the mathematics necessary to understand and work to create change in a number of politically charged areas. You may find areas where you disagree with the material presented or find that it challenges things you believe are true.  That's ok. Education, fundamentally, is about challenging what you already know and learning about new things. You may find, through your research and work in this class, that your views don't change. You may find that they do. Our goal, in Math for the People, is to present factual information and to teach you the quantitative tools you need to understand that information. We encourage you to look at other data, work through your own examples, and see how it agrees or disagrees with what is presented in the text. While we do not hesitate to present our own viewpoint, which we believe is supported by the quantitative data, these are complicated problems and there may be other solutions we're not considering.  In working through these topics with your class, we encourage you to follow the following guidelines, plus any additional guidelines that your class agrees on (these guidelines are adapted from ):   Listen to others, rather than just waiting for your chance to speak.  Don't interrupt or talk over your classmates.  Use \"I\" statements, like \"I believe,\" \"I think,\" \"I feel.\" There's a big difference between a statement like \"I believe X is true\" and \"X is true.\"  Support your arguments with evidence, especially with quantitative evidence.  Give everyone the chance to speak. If you feel like you are monopolizing the discussion, take a step back and give someone else the chance to talk.  Avoid personal attacks. You can disagree with someone's ideas without attacking that person.  Do not use language which is offensive or denigrates a particular group. Stereotypes and bigotry are inappropriate in the classroom.  If someone does say something offensive unintentionally, give them space to learn from their mistake. You can share your discomfort with the instructor, who will help them understand why what they said was hurtful.  Assume accountability for your words and actions.  Share the lesson, not the story. Students may share personal information in class which should remain confidential. You can talk about what you learned without sharing the personal details your classmate shared.

  "body": " Big Problem: Restricting Abortion Access  The Supreme Court's ruling in Row v Wade on January 22, 1973, gave people in the United States legal access to abortion across the United States. The ruling was based on the right to privacy which is protected by the 14th Amendment. Since this ruling, there have been numerous attempts to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 decision.  These attempts primarily arise when a state passes their own law defining when and how a person can legally get an abortion. When a state passes their own laws, the legality of these laws are often challenged by advocacy groups for access to abortion. These challenges are brought to the court system and can reach as high as the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has the right to decide which cases they will review. Their decision to see a case and\/or their decisions in these cases can change accessibility to legal abortion within the United States. This is precisely what happened on June 24, 2022.  In December 2021, the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. In this case, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization and one of its doctors challenged that the Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act violated a constitutional right to abortion. This Act states:  \"[e]xcept in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks\"[Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191]   Lower courts had ruled the Mississippi Gestational Age Act as unconstitutional because under the 1973 decision on Roe v. Wade, it was prohibited to ban abortions before a fetus was considered to survive outside a woman’s womb.  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court sided with Dobbs, who was the head of the Mississippi Health Department in 2018. This decision is based on the idea that access to abortion is not a constitutional right because, in fact, there is no inherent right to privacy or personal autonomy in the Constitution. Now that precedent has been set that there is no constitutional right to privacy, many other U.S Supreme Court cases are subject to be re-examined that could result in a major set-back to the civil rights movement. These include, but certainly not limited to, legality of same-sex marriages, inter-racial marriages, and contraception.  Immediately following this historical Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe, there were 16 states in which abortion became illegal, banned, or had trigger laws in place . Trigger laws don’t take effect immediately or require some proactive intervention such as attorney general certification.  While the consequences of overturning Roe remains uncertain, what is not uncertain are people’s beliefs about abortion. A person typically identifies as \"pro-choice\" or \"pro-life\". In the following sections, we explore the logic of three topics at the center of people’s beliefs. These topics are bodily autonomy, inequity in abortion access, and when \"life\" starts.  "

  "title": "Simple Logic",
  "body": " Simple Logic   A mathematical statement is a sentence that is either true or false, but not both at the same time. For example, consider the following sentences:  The Supreme Court’s ruling on Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973 gave people the right to access abortion legally all across the country  The Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 making abortion a federal crime within the United States.  Abortion should be illegal.    The first sentence is a sentence which is true, making the sentence a mathematical statement. The second sentence is false which also means that it is a mathematical statement. Lastly, the third sentence is an opinion which is neither true nor false. Therefore, the third sentence is not a mathematical statement. Determining if a sentence is a statement can be challenging as this causes us to challenge the difference between our individual belief systems and factual information. We will discuss this in further detail in our last section of this module.  Mathematical statements, or simply statements , are the building blocks to mathematical logic. While mathematicians primarily focus on statements that involve mathematics such as, \"The number 2 is greater than 0\", the methods used by mathematicians to make sense of their discipline can be applied to other topics which use critical thinking.  There are a series of operations that we can perform on statements to get new statements. This is analogous to taking two numbers and adding, subtracting, or multiplying to get a new number. In algebra, the letters , , and are often used to represent numbers. These are called variables . In logic we typically use the variables , , and to represent a statement. When we perform an operation on one or more statements, we will call the result a compound statement . It is important to note that the resulting statement is, in fact, a statement. This means that a compound statement must either be true or false, but not both at the same time.    Negating and Combining Statements with \"and\" and \"or\"   Negations  The negation of a given statement switches the truth value of the original statement. For example, the negation of \"Abortion is a federal crime\" is \"Abortion is not a federal crime\". Many times, a statement can be negated by inserting the word \"not\", or an equivalent word into the original statement. There are many ways to symbolically represent the negation of a statement. For this module, if we represent a statement by the variable , we represent the negation of by . We can use a logic calculator to see how the value of and are related. In the calculation above, the left most column represents the values for and the column under \"value\" represents the corresponding values for .    And & Or  As we can see, when is true, is false and vice versa.The calculator used above generated a truth table. A truth table is a table that will produce the truth values for compound statements based off of the statement variable which are typically placed to the left of the table and the truth values for the compound statement which are typically to the right in the table. We will use this truth table generator for the remainder of this module.  Two more common ways to make a compound statement is by taking two simple statements and combining them with either the word \"or\" or \"and\". For example, consider the two statements \" In August 2022, abortion is legal with not gestational limit in the state of New Jersey\"and \"In August 2022, abortion was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama\" . We can combine these statements in the following two ways:  In August 2022, abortion is legal with no gestational limit in the state of New Jersey or in August 2022, abortion was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama.  In August 2022, abortion is legal with no gestational limit in the state of New Jersey and in August 2022, abortion was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama.  These statements are a bit awkward and can be rewritten without losing their meaning as simply:  In August 2022, abortion is legal with not gestational limit in the state of New Jersey or was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama.  In August 2022, abortion is legal with not gestational limit in the state of New Jersey and was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama.  Both of these compound statements are true statements because the original simple statements are both true. The truth table for an \"or\" statement, more formally known as a disjunction is given below: The truth table for an \"and\" statement, more formally known as a conjunction is given next: The columns on the far left represent all possible truth values of the simple statements and used in the compound statement. The entries on the far left of each row represent the different truth value of the simple statements used in the compound statement. The final column on the far right represents the truth value of the compound statement for the given simple statement truth values. For example the second row in the truth table above reads \"When is true and is false, and is false\".     Equivalent Statements  Given a statement , we say that a statement is equivalent to if they have the same truth value. We denote equivalent statements, and , by . For example, because for corresponding values of and , these compound statements have the same truth results. This can be seen by examining the truth tables below:   Because equivalent statements have the same truth value, we can interchange one for the other without losing the meaning of a statement. Let's try the following example. You may find the following website helpful for entering in the symbols used in these calculators Propositional Calculus .    Determine which of the following statements is equivalent to :                 Not equivalent  Equivalent  not equivalent      The examples above are called DeMorgan’s Laws. Summarizing DeMorgan’s Laws:        There are many other equivalent statements, as we will see in the next section.    Implications (If-Then Statements)  An implication is a statement that has a premise and a conclusion such as, \"If I take birth control, then I can’t get pregnant\". In this implication, the premise is the statement \"I take birth control\" and the conclusion is the statement \"I can’t get pregnant\". With an implication, the truth value of the premise and conclusion determine the truth value of the actual implication. Given two statements and , the statement: if , then can be represented by and read as \"if , then \", \" implies \", \" only if \", and \" , if \". Below is the truth table for the implication \"if , then \":   The truth value of implications can be counterintuitive at times. This occurs primarily when the premise is false because the implication will always be true. For example the implications below are true since the implications in all are false:  If abortions are federally protected, then people will use abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies.  If abortions are federally protected, then people will not use abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies.  If abortions are a federal crime, then more women will be jailed.  If abortions are a federal crime, then more women will be jailed.  In these statements, it seems as if only one of the first two statements should be true and one of the last two statements should be true as the conclusions are negations of one another. However, all four statements are true.  It turns out that the only way for an implication to be false is when the premise is true and the conclusion is false. An example would be, \"If abortions are not a federally protected right, then no-one will get an abortion\".  Another counterintuitive concept that arises with implications is their negation. The negation, is equivalent to the statement . This is verified by examining their truth tables.      Verify that the following statements are not equivalent to using the truth table generator below:                  Not equivalent  Not equivalent  Equivalent  not equivalent      It is important to notice that the negation of an implication is not an implication. For example, the negation of \"If abortions are federally protected, then people will not use abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies\" is \"Abortions are federally protected and people use abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies\" which is a false statement.

  "title": "Quantifiers",
  "body": " Quantifiers  A quantifier is a way of indicating quantity within a statement. We know words that indicate quantity such as all, many, some, or none. In logic, these are the words that are used as the quantifiers. They indicate how many of what have a particular attribute or quality. Consider the following examples:   Some abortions are medically necessary.   All children deserve to live.   No abortion supporter deserves a vacation.    One important tool that supports us when working with statements with quantifiers is the use of Venn Diagrams and set representations. Sets help us have a more clear perspective in forming negations and understanding the truth value of statements. Let’s start with the simple statements that use quantities, and then build to a more complicated statement like the one from the previous section, \"If abortions are not a federally protected right, then no one will get an abortion.\"  Let's consider the statement that some abortions are medically necessary. The word some is a quantifier. The reference set is the set of all abortions. The set of abortions for medical reasons is what we would consider a subset. Exploring the legitimacy of this subset is how we decide on strategies for negation. Our main strategy is driven by determining if there are abortions in the subset \"abortions for medical reasons.\" A quick web search can help us determine if there are abortions for medical reasons (see https:\/\/www.health.com\/news\/abortion-medically-necessary as an example), meaning that the set of abortions for medical reasons is not an empty set. This web article discusses that the medical reason may be for both the mother or the unborn fetus. We can use our understanding of the characteristics and membership of the sets to help us think further when working with statements about the sets.   A rectangle representing the set of all abortions with a blue circle contained inside this rectangle. The circle represents abortions needed for medical reasons.  A subset of abortions needed for medical reasons among the set of all abortions.   We can use the membership of the set and subset to help develop strategies for negating statements. As previously stated, negations switch the truth value of a statement. This would also be true for quantified statements, except the change happens by altering the quantity. We established previously that the statement \"Some abortions are medically necessary,\" is a true statement. So we need to think about ways to use quantity and set membership to change the truth value. In this case, our negation would be to find a false statement. Since we know that some abortions are for medical reasons, the most direct negation is to claim that no abortions are medically necessary. We know that this statement is false, as we can produce information about abortions that are medically necessary for the safety of the mother. The statement, \"No abortions are medically necessary,\" would propose that there is not an element in the set abortions for medical reasons.This switches the truth value from the original statement, \"Some abortions are medically necessary.\"  One question that you may have is why the statement, \"All abortions are medically necessary,\" is not a valid negation. It may in fact be a valid negation, but we have to meet some specific criteria for it to be valid. Let’s talk about what needs to happen for the negation with \"All abortions are medically necessary,\" to be valid. The statement implies that all of the abortions in the set of all abortions are also in the set of abortions for medical reasons. Now let's consider our original statement, \"Some abortions are medically necessary.\" It is logically equivalent to the statement, \"Not all abortions are medically necessary.\" The negation of this equivalent statement happens when we state that there are no members in the set of all abortions that are not also in the set of abortions for medical reasons. This is a more complicated process because it is not direct. We created an equivalent statement that was then negated. Typically the more steps that are involved in a process, the more room you have to make errors. Logic is no exception.  Let's now consider the statement, \"All children deserve to live.\" This is a common quantified statement that is offered in abortion debates. Let's discuss the sets, and think independently about potential subsets that can exist.   A rectangle representing the set of all children with a blue circle contained inside this rectangle. The circle represents children who deserve to live.  A subset of children among all children.   So, let's take some time to consider this set image. We know that the set of children that deserve to live is a subset of the set of all children. Our goal is to think about if there are any subsets or groups of children that should be excluded from the set of children that deserve to live, but would still be considered part of the set of all children. As an author, I have contemplated the question of if these sets were different for quite a long time, and I continue to come to the conclusion that the sets are the same.  This equivalence of sets helps give us a strategy for negation. We know that every child is in both the set of all children and the set of children that deserve to live. If we can find a single child that does not belong in the set of children that deserve to live but still belongs to the set of all children, then we can negate the statement with the claim, \"At least one child does not deserve to live.\" It seriously only takes one to negate the statement, but we know that case is not likely to exist. Another equivalent statement that is an option for a negation is the statement, \"Some children do not deserve to live.\" These two statements both claim that there are children that do not belong in the set of children that deserve to live.  Now, let's consider the statement, \"No abortion supporter deserves a vacation.\" This claim is a bit more complex, so let's start with our sets. We will lay out the sets the way that they are proposed in the statement.   A rectangle representing the set of all people. A circle contained represents people who support abortions and another disjoint circle represents people who deserve vacations.  Different subsets of people.   Notice that there is no overlap shown between the set of people that deserve vacations and the set of people that support abortions. We are starting with a diagram that matches the original claim of the statement. We use this to establish the initial truth value of the statement. Vacations tend to be labeled as something that is a privilege, but really vacations are just a break from work or school (https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/vacation). It appears that everyone deserves a vacation, so the set of all people and the set of people that deserve a vacation are equivalent sets. We also know that people that support abortion are people, who would also need a vacation. This means that the initial claim is false. Let’s think about strategies to work with the statement, so that we can approach negation. Our first step would be to update the set diagram.   A rectangle representing the set of people who deserve a vacation. Insidet his rectangle is a circle representing people who support abortion rights.  Different subsets of people.   The most clear path to a negation, which in this case is the creation of a true statement, is to use the set diagram to generate a statement. In this case it will take the form of a statement about all people that support abortion. The statement, “All abortion supporters deserve a vacation.” would be a negation of the original statement, \"No abortion supporter deserves a vacation.\"  A more complicated version of a quantified statement is the statement, \"If abortions are not federally protected, then no one will get an abortion.\" This statement is more complicated because of the fact it is a conditional statement. When there is a conditional statement and a quantifier, we can think about combining the diagrams for two separate sets. The first set is related to the condition, and it is split between \"Abortion is federally protected,\" and \"Abortion is not federally protected.\" The set diagram provides the following base.   A rectangle split in half. The left side represents where abortion is federally protected and the right side represents where abortion is not federally protected.  Different subsets of where abortions are protected and not protected.   Now we have a secondary set to think about: people getting abortions. The question that we have to ask ourselves becomes: Will abortions still happen if abortions are not federally protected? In prior sections, we discussed that some abortions are medically necessary. There are also (while often dramatized for television, like Law and Order: SVU (see Season 12, Episode 9: “Gray” as a specific example) scenarios where one partner in a couple will go to desperate lengths to terminate a pregnancy. A medication is administered to terminate the pregnancy. One issue that was debated during the episode was if the action of the partner was technically an abortion. The court determined that it met the legal definition of an abortion because medical means were used to terminate a pregnancy. We use this example, not only because it is widely available via the internet, but to demonstrate that abortion does not require a medical practitioner. This means that even without clinics and medical practitioners, abortions will still happen. This means that overlaying the second set gives us a diagram that looks something like the set diagram below.   A rectangle split in half. The left side represents where abortion is federally protected and the right side represents where abortion is not federally protected. On top of both regions is an overlapping rectangle representing people who get an abortion.  Different subsets of where abortions are protected and not protected along with a subset of people who get abortions.   We can see that the set of people who will get an abortion is evenly split over the two scenarios of abortion being federally protected or not being federally protected. This means that when we think about the original statement, “If abortions are not federally protected, then no one will get an abortion,” we can see that this is a false statement as long as the set of people who will get an abortion is not an empty set. We have strong reason to believe that this set is not empty, both from the example from the Law and Order example as well as the case of medical abortions mentioned previously.  "

  "type": "Section",
  "number": "1.7",
  "title": "Arguments",
  "body": " Arguments   Typically we think about an argument as a fight between people. However, a mathematical argument is different. A mathematical argument is a collection of statements called premises and a conclusion. Below is an example of an argument: My state made it illegal to get an abortion after 6 weeks gestation. I just found out that I am pregnant and I am 8 weeks pregnant. Therefore, I cannot legally get an abortion in my state.   The premises are the first two sentences. The conclusion is the last sentence. Typically, conclusions are identified by such words as ''therefore'', ''thus'', ''hence'', etc. The goal of this section is to explain how to turn a written argument into a symbolic argument that can be evaluated using truth tables. It should be noted that we may need to be flexible with this translation and there are often many ways to interpret sentences as statements.  We begin with the last example: \"My state made it illegal to get an abortion after 6 weeks gestation. I just found out that I am pregnant and I am 8 weeks pregnant. Therefore, I cannot legally get an abortion in my state.\" We can reword this to the following: If I am more than 6 weeks pregnant, it is illegal to get an abortion in my state. I am more than 6 weeks pregnant. Therefore, it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state.   We are now ready to identify two main statements: let represent \"I am more than 6 weeks pregnant\" and let represent \"It is illegal to get an abortion in my state\".  Once we have converted the sentences into simple statements connected through our logical operations (if-then statements, and's, or's, negations), we need to address the punctuation in an argument. We do this by taking all of the premises and creating one run-on sentence. In other words, we remove every period and replace it with the word \"and\". In our example we reduce the argument to two sentences. The first sentence consists of the run-on sentence of premises. The second sentence is the conclusion of the argument. We have: If I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state and I am more than 6 weeks pregnant. Therefore, it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state. The last step needed before we convert the argument into symbolic notation is to turn these two sentences into one \"if-then\" statement. We do this in the following way: If (insert run-on sentence consisting of all premises), then (insert conclusion). We may need to be a bit flexible while reading this new one-sentence argument. In this example, it is very strange to read:  If If I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state and I am more than 6 weeks pregnant, then it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state. Instead, it is easier to read and understand the following equivalent statement:  If it is the case that if I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state and I am more than 6 weeks pregnant, then it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state.   We are now ready to turn this argument into a symbolic argument. Let $q$ be “I am more than 6 weeks pregnant” and let $p$ be “It is illegal to get an abortion in my state”. We have the following symbolic argument:   We generalize this process below: Suppose an argument consists of the premises and the conclusion . The corresponding symbolic form of this argument is: Once an argument has been turned into its symbolic form, we can determine if the argument is valid and\/or sound. These concepts are addressed in the next two sections.    Valid Arguments  A mathematical argument is valid if it is always true. In other words, the final column of an argument’s truth table will consist of only true values. For the argument presented in the previous section, we see the truth table is: making this a valid argument.    Show that the following argument is not valid. \"If access to abortion is restricted in a state, then the number of abortions in that state will decrease. The number of abortions decreased in that state. Consequently, access to abortion is restricted in that state.\"\"      Show that the following argument is valid. \"If a state restricts access to abortion, then the number of abortions will decrease in that state. The number of abortions did not decrease in that state. Therefore, the state did not restrict access to abortion.\"\"    These last two examples highlight that the validity of an argument does not depend on the actual statements being used. Instead validity focuses only on the structure of the argument. This means that an argument can be valid, but may not be sound- a concept discussed in the next example. .   Sound Arguments  A valid argument is called sound if its premises are true. If a valid argument is not sound, we say that it is unsound. In the last example, the two premises are  If a state restricts access to abortion, then the number of abortions will decrease in that state.  The number of abortions did not decrease in that state.    Both premises would need to be supported by factual data to determine if they are either true or false. However, historically it has been shown that restricting access to abortion does not reduce the number of abortions. Instead, restricting access to abortion reduces the number of safe abortions performed . Using this historical data, we could conclude that Premise 1 above is false. Thus making this argument unsound.  When a valid argument is sound, this means that the conclusion of the argument can be inferred from true statements. When a valid argument is unsound, this means the conclusion of the argument is being inferred from false statements thus making the actual argument less credible.   "

  "title": "Definitions, Assumptions, and Fallacies",
  "body": " Definitions, Assumptions, and Fallacies   As we navigate arguments there are several special language features that we need to be aware of to help us communicate clearly and effectively. These features are definitions, assumptions, and logical fallacies. These features will be discussed below.  A definition is a common meaning for a term that is held by a group. For example, if you asked various people to define the term dog, you would get similar answers from almost everyone that you asked. That is because the definition has many commonly experienced attributes such as being a pet or companion. One thing to be mindful about with definitions is that not all groups hold common definitions for the same term. One example would be the definition of abortion held by different groups. Some consider any termination of a pregnancy, no matter the reason, to be an abortion. Other groups consider abortion to be any elective termination of a pregnancy. This slight difference in how the groups define the common term can make discussions between individuals contentious.  An assumption is a sentence that is accepted in an argument as true. Some assumptions are understood, or what we call tacit assumptions. An example of a tacit assumption would be the mental image that you generate from the sentence, \"Those not yet born have been dehumanized, and so many of those born have faced increasing marginalization due to their age, ability, or perceived value\". You most likely imagine a fetus and not a robot or rock. That is because we have a tacit assumption that robots cannot be born. This sentence is part of the mission statement of the pro life advocacy group Americans United for Life   Other assumptions are stated more directly. This means that the assumptions are made explicit. When we make explicit assumptions, we speak them directly. An example of a directly spoken assumption would be the following quote,\"We see that criminalization is not as much about the behavior of the individual, but the individual itself and the identities that they hold. We know that Black and Latinx and other folks of color are more likely to be criminalized by our criminal legal system. We know the same thing is true for young people, LGBTQ folks, undocumented communities. So the risks are high for criminalization overall. We are seeing this play out in the reproductive health care space right now and it's going to get worse.\"-Jamila Perritt, MD, MPH, FACOG—President & CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health   This statement directly addresses that specific groups will face potentially punitive consequences when navigating the reproductive health system, if they are able to navigate it at all. Pause for a moment to think about internal and external features that might limit access to reproductive health for certain groups.  An assumption can sometimes be indicated by the presence of words like let, suppose, and assume in regular speech and writing. This particular type of language invites a listener or reader to engage with the possibilities that follow from an initial claim that is assumed to be true.It is important to be aware that not all assumptions are true. For social issues this is especially true. Assuming that certain parts of an argument are true, without proper investigation or consideration, can lead to false conclusions. One example of an assumption that can lead to false conclusions is using a non-shared definition.  For example, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines abortion as the \"termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely follow by the death of the embryo or fetus\" . However when Catherin Glenn Foster, the President and CEO of Americans United for Life was asked if an abortion occurred in the scenario of a 10-year old rape victim who became pregnant, and terminated the pregnancy, Foster replied that an abortion did not occur because “it would probably impact [the girl’s] life, and so, therefore, it would fall under any exception and would not be an abortion.” Foster later clarified that “If a 10-year old became pregnant as a result of rape and it was threatening her life, then that’s not an abortion”.   A logical fallacy is a flawed, deceptive, or false argument that can be proven wrong with proper reasoning. Arguments, as we have learned, are an important part of social interactions. This is especially true when dealing with controversial topics. Logical fallacies tend to arise commonly with controversial topics because of the presence of tacit assumptions and unshared definitions. In this section, we are going to learn to identify and refute logical fallacies.  If you look online, you will see long lists of specific false arguments. It is less important to know the names of the false arguments and have memorized strategies to win arguments than it is to be able to recognize that an argument, in general, is a bad argument. Let’s look at the following case studies.    Case Study 1   In this case study, an anti-abortion blog discusses supposed fallacies and misinformation about abortion. For this specific case analysis, we are focusing on the section titled “What if the Baby is Deformed?” Read this section carefully, and then we will discuss the argument presented by the author.   An image of the argument from abort73.com  A snippet from the website abort73.com with the argument about when babies are deformed.    An image of the continuation of the argument from abort73.com  A snippet from the website abort73.com with the argument about when babies are deformed.     Case Study 1: The Argument  The author of the blog post makes a very decisive claim. The claim that the author is making is that: If a parent is an abortion supporter and a child is diagnosed with an disability before birth, then the parent will abort the child. If the child is diagnosed with a disability before birth and the parent aborts the child, then the parents do not support people with disabilities. Therefore, abortion supporters do not support people with disabilities. We can assign each statement in the following way:   : A parent is an abortion supporter.   : A child is diagnosed with a disability before birth.   : The parent will abort the child.   : Aboftion supporters do not support people with disabilities.  This can be represented by the following: . Use the truth table generator to determine if this is a valid argument.    Case Study 1: Discussion  It is clear that the author of the blog post does not support abortion. They also propose that supporters of abortion believe that children with disabilities that are diagnosable during pregnancy should be aborted, and therefore people that support abortion do not support members of the disabled community. One tacit assumption that the author makes is the claim that abortion is not an appropriate treatment for a physical or mental disability. The fallacy happens when the author states that making the choice to abort a child with a diagnosed disability is the same as not being a supporter of the disabled community. This type of fallacy is specifically called an equivocation because the author claims that two different things are in fact the same.    Case Study 1: Refuting the Argument  No matter which side of the argument for or against abortion you may fall on, you have an obligation to present an accurate argument. The largest flaw in the argument was the claim that mental disabilities can be diagnosed during pregnancy, which in some cases is true for genetic disorders like Downs Syndrome; however, not all mental disabilities can be diagnosed during pregnancy. One strategy to address this flaw is to look at data. If someone claims that a disability diagnosis justifies getting an abortion, we should check on data about children with disabilities. One place that might give us this information is the US Census, specifically the report on childhood disability . The report shows that nationally, from 2008 to 2019, the percentage of children that were reported as disabled increased during the time period. This is a neutral fact that participants on either side of the abortion debate can use to better defend a position. If someone is anti-abortion, then they can claim that an increase in children with disabilities means that more parents are being educated about options besides abortion and selecting those options for themselves and their unborn child. If someone is an abortion supporter, they can use the increase in children with disabilities to defend themselves against claims that they believe that unborn children with diagnosable birth defects deserve to be terminated. This is one strategy to refute this type of argument.  Another strategy is to ask specific questions that relate to why you personally have issues with the argument, and why you believe it to contain a fallacy. If you have questions about the diagnosis of mental disability during pregnancy, as an example, asking questions can help clarify meaning for both parties. You can get information about the meaning of mental disability from the other party because perhaps they have a different definition than what you have. This clarification is something that you could not have gained without having a productive discussion with another person. That is why it is a general strategy for exploring and refuting arguments.     Case Study 2   In this next case study, we examine the argument that “life begins at conception”. Many pro life groups claim that life begins at conception. One such group is Pro-Life Wisconsin . On this organization’s webpage , they write:  An image of the argument from Pro-Life Wisconsin  A snippet from the Pro-Life Wisconsin's website.    The argument can be summarized by the following argument: Scientists agree that a human embryo is a human being immediate at conception. If you are a human being then you are alive. Thus, human life begins at conception.   : A human embryo is created immediately after fertilization.   : A human embryo is alive.  This can be represented by the following: . Use the truth table generator to determine if this is a valid argument.  We can see that this argument is valid using a truth table. However, it is not a sound argument. With no definition of “alive” given, this is an example of the fallacy Begging the Question, where a premise of an argument assumes the truth of the conclusion. Another example of begging the question can be found in the article, Familiar flaws in pro-life argument , published in the Montgomery Advertiser .    Case Study 2: Discussion  It turns out that trying to determine when life begins is a very difficult task particularly because there is no agreed upon definition of the word “life”. Nevertheless, since the US Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion, state legislators have been trying to codify the definition of life oftentimes without input from medical professionals. The codification of “life” would impact abortion rights, birth control, and assisted reproduction .  Some common definitions of beginning of life include at conception, with a heartbeat, at first breath, or the ability to live outside of a womb with the help of the latest technology . It turns out that when more technology is available, the harder this definition becomes. For example, before ultrasounds it was assumed that life began with “quickening”, or when the woman first felt a fetus move. However, this is often before a fetus can survive outside of a womb. Additionally, heart beats can be heard much earlier than feeling a fetus move.

It is unlikely that you will be able to change the opinions of other people, but being able to provide factual information and state sound, valid arguments that are free of fallacies will help increase awareness of the consequences of restricting or banning access to abortion.

  "title": "Understanding the Issue",
  "body": " Understanding the Issue   In the southern state of Louisiana, along the lower Mississippi River, nearly 150 oil refineries, plastics plants, and chemical facilities are located between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Environmentalists call this 85-mile-long stretch the Chemical Corridor or Cancer Alley, while industrialists adopted the name Industrial corridor to describe this region. As the name suggests, residents of this area are 50 times more susceptible to get cancer compared the national average , in some parishes the chance being even higher. In a 1991 interview, Amos Favorite, a resident of Ascension Parish on the Cancer Alley stated,  I lost my Uncle James Barber and his son Israel I lost another uncle, Jorden Favorite, his wife, Pipine, and their son Isaac. Then there was another uncle, Herbert Favorite. My cousins Lizzie and Emily died in their 40s. Then there was my aunt’s husband, Josene LeBlanc Our people used to live to be 95, 100, years old Now even the young people are dyin’. [Reed 1991]   This is the reality of one of many families living on the Cancer Alley.   A chemical plant. Dirty steam and smoke rise from a dense mass of industrial structures.  Chemical facilities in Baton Rouge .   Louisiana is one of the highest producers of hazardous waste materials in the United States . Every year, the chemical factories located in the state, especially on the cancer alley releases vast amount of carbon-dioxide and millions of pounds of poisonous chemicals, thus jeopardizing the health of the residents and the people working in the chemical facilities . The toxic chemicals do not only pollute the air, but unsustainable waste disposal systems, chemical release from factories, and seepage of fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural production also contaminate drinking water. A study by Gottlieb, Carr, and Morris reported that the residents of cancer alley, who get their drinking water from Mississippi river are 2.1 times more susceptible to rectal cancer compared to those who depends on an alternate source for their drinking water. Apart from cancer, skin inflammation, significant respiratory problems, and a range of other health threats have also been predominant among the people living in the cancer alley .  Although the cancer is highly predominant among all the people residing in the Cancer Alley, African American people bear a disproportionate burden of cancer mortality compared to the other racial counterparts. Between 1995 and 2006, while the cancer mortality rate of the white men and women were 250 and 167 per 100,000 population, the mortality rate of African American men and women were 395 and 214 per 100,000 population respectively . One of the reasons behind this glaring difference in the cancer mortality rate is probably because most of the chemical factories and hazardous waste sites on the Cancer Alley are established in areas which are heavily resided by impoverished, people of color. According to Castellón “there is little evidence that communities of color move to sites where toxic waste facilities and landfills are located. Rather, toxic waste sites are often sited in primarily poor and African American neighborhoods” . While affluent white communities are often able to \"leverage their economic and political clout\" to prevent establishment of unwanted facilities in their neighborhoods , lack of political support and money, disable people of color to relocate or afford legal representations to fight big industrial facilities moving to their localities . Such disproportionate burden of environmental harms on a particular socio-economic and racial group is called environmental racism   In this lesson, we will explore the topic of environmental racism through the case of cancer alley. We will extract racial composition data of people living along the 85-mile-long stretch of the Chemical Corridor and use data visualization to compare and identify the disproportionate impact of the chemical factories on African American people.

Because of this, chemical and petroleum companies often try to find jurisdictions which are less likely to regulate their pollution, like those in Louisiana's Cancer Alley. These companies thus save the money that they would have needed to spend to mitigate pollution in other areas. Major companies that have factories and refineries in Cancer Alley include Chevron, DuPont, Exxon Mobil, and Shell .  The products produced at these plants are used by factories to create the products that we use, like plastics, building materials, and cleaning supplies. While we are not individually responsible, it is important to think about the role that our consumption plays in encouraging the type of pollution we see in Cancer Alley.  "

  "title": "Data Classification",
  "body": " Data Classification   Once you collect or obtain a data set, you need to choose which form of data visualization(s) would be appropriate for your data. But before you can determine the best form of data visualization, you need to classify your data. The nature of your data would help you determine the possible forms of visualizations. In the following section, we will discuss the different types of data with examples.    Data types  Let’s say you are conducting a neighborhood welfare survey. The survey aims to learn about the different issues the residents are concerned about and want the local authorities to address immediately. The survey contains a combination of ten closed and open-ended questions. For details about the survey, see \\vref{pictureX}. Overall, the survey questions collected two types of data: non-numeric (Questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 9) and numeric (Questions 3, 4, 7, 8, 10), based on which the data can be broadly classified into two types: categorical data and quantitative data.   Diagram showing the division between categorical and quantitative data.  All data can be divided into categorical and quantitative data.   Data that are non-numeric or qualitative in nature, and that can be classified into different categories; are called Categorical Data. For example, question 2 of the survey asked the respondents, “What are some issues, if at all, in your neighborhood that concerns you the most?” It provided the respondents with nine non-numeric options to choose from,   Lack of proper waste disposal system  Air Pollution  Access to healthy drinking water  Lack of green spaces\/ parks\/ playground  Availability of healthcare system  Risk of flooding\/ forest fire  Access to grocery stores\/ neighborhood market  Unsafe road conditions  Others   Each response forms a category; hence, question 2 collected categorical data.  Data that are numeric in nature and hence quantifiable, are called quantitative data . Question 7 in the survey asked the respondents, “How many people live in your household?” Such variables “Number of people” would record data that are numbers; hence are called quantitative data.   Neighborhood welfare survey - include text description of survey.  Neighborhood welfare survey.   Categorical data can further be classified into two types: nominal data and ordinal data.  Let us refocus on Question 2 of the survey, “What are some issues, if at all, in your neighborhood that concerns you the most?” The question provided the respondents with nine non-numeric options,   Lack of proper waste disposal system  Air Pollution  Access to healthy drinking water  Lack of green spaces\/ parks\/ playground  Availability of healthcare system  Risk of flooding\/ forest fire  Access to grocery stores\/ neighborhood market  Unsafe road conditions  Others   These nine options form nine categories whose order is not essential. Such qualitative data, which can be classified into different categories, but the order of the categories is not important, are called Nominal Data .  Nominal data can be counted and hence it can be used to calculate the number of times or the percentage of times a particular category has been selected. No other meaningful mathematical operations can be performed on Nominal Data.  Categorical data, where the order of the categories is important, is called Ordinal data . Question 10 of the survey asked the respondents, “How satisfied are you with your local government’s initiatives to address issues present in your community?” It provided the respondents with five non-numeric options: Extremely satisfied, satisfied, Average, Dissatisfied, and Extremely Dissatisfied. Here, the five options create five categories, and there exists a natural ordering between these categories. Hence such data is Ordinal in nature.  Like nominal data, you can count ordinal data and use them to calculate the number of times or the percentage of times a particular category has been selected. However, some disagreement exists about whether you can perform any other mathematical operations, especially calculate the average, with Ordinal Data. When Ordinal data is in non-numeric form, you cannot calculate its average and measure the average response of the respondents. However, sometimes numbers are assigned to the different categories of Ordinal data for easier data entry and analysis (5: Extremely satisfied, 4: satisfied, 3: Average, 2: Dissatisfied, and 1: Extremely Dissatisfied). Although these numbers do not have any true mathematical value, you can often use these numbers to calculate the average response under the assumption that the difference in degree between consecutive categories is approximately equal.  Quantitative data can also be classified into two types: interval and ratio data.  Let us start with an example. Question 4 of the survey asked the respondents, “At what time do you experience the heaviest traffic in your neighborhood? Imagine how a respondent would respond to that question? 7:30 AM? 8 AM? All the responses will record the time of the day. Such data is numerical and will be classified as Interval Data .  Interval data are numerical, and as a result, the interval between the consecutive points of measurement are uniform. Whether someone experiences the heaviest traffic at 8 AM or 8:30 AM, or 9 AM, the difference between all the three timings is consistently 30 minutes or .5 hours.  Since interval data is numeric, you can perform any mathematical operation, but interval data does not have any meaningful zero. For example, suppose Sunday at midnight, there was an accident in your neighborhood, and as a result, there was massive traffic in your neighborhood. One way to measure the timing is through a 24-hour clock and say that your neighborhood experienced unusual traffic at 0:00 AM on Sunday. Here zero does not mean that there is an absence of time. Zero is just the measure of the time of the day using a 24-hour clock.  To understand Ratio Data, let us get back to question 7, where the survey asked the respondents, “How many people live in your household?” Unlike Interval data, in this question, if you say that zero people live in the household, it means that no people live in the household. So, in Ratio data , the value zero indicates an absence of a measure.  Like interval data, ratio data is numeric in nature. Hence, the interval between the consecutive points of measurement is uniform, and you can perform any mathematical operations on it.

  "title": "Choosing Data Visualizations",
  "body": " Choosing Data Visualizations   Data visualization is a way to graphically represent data and information by using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps. The purposes of data visualizations are to summarize, compare, reveal patterns, and notice anomalies present in the data; in other words, data visualization makes data more understandable to an individual.    Why is data visualization important?  In the world of big data, where we have access to a large amount of information, it is an essential skill for an individual to learn to handle a significant volume of data and devise a quick and effective way to present the data in meaningful ways to others. Data visualization is a tool that serves such purposes. It provides an intuitive way to visualize and understand trends, outliers, clusters, and patterns in given data sets. Data visualization also helps us compare different data sets and prompts us to raise questions that stimulate research and suggest ideas. It offers a meaningful way to tell a story from data but with a purpose.    Types of Data Visualizations   Once you identify your data type, you can choose your data visualizations accordingly. For guidance, see :     Number of Variables  Data Types  Visualizations    1  Categorical Data  Nominal Data  Pie Chart          Bar Graph        Ordinal Data  Pie Chart          Bar Graph      Quantitative Data  Interval Data  Histogram          Bar Graph        Ratio Data  Histogram          Bar Graph    2  Quantitative Data  Interval Data  Scattered Plot        Ratio Data  Scattered Plot     A brief account of each of the data visualization is given below:    Pie charts  A pie chart is a visual tool that graphs categorical data and helps one understand the part-to-a-whole relationship. Visually a pie chart is circular in shape that is divided into sectors, where each sector represents the number or percentage of times an observation or category has been selected. The pie chart given in Figure~\\ref{fig:Pie}, represents the the number or percentage of times respondents expressed concerns about their neighborhood issues. Each sector of the pie chart represents a distinct category, that is a particular neighborhood issue.  The pie chart given in shows that   15% times respondents expressed their concerns about improper waste disposal system,  10% times respondents expressed their concerns about air pollution,  20% times respondents expressed their concerns about access to healthy drinking water,  6% times respondents expressed their concerns about lack of greenspaces\/ parks\/ playgrounds,  14% times respondents expressed their concerns about availability of healthcare system,  2% times respondents expressed their concerns about risk of flooding\/ forest fire,  11% times respondents expressed their concerns about access to grocery stores\/ neighborhood market,  18% times they expressed their concerns about unsafe road conditions, and  4% times they expressed their concerns about other neighborhood issues not included in the list.   The important thing to know about a pie chart is that the bigger the area of the sectors, the greater the values they represent. That means, in the given pie chart, since the area of the sector representing “Access to healthy drinking water” is the highest (20% of the total area), you can conclude that out of the nine given issues, the respondents chose \"Access to healthy drinking water” the maximum number of times. To be precise, 20% of the times respondents said that they were concerned about healthy drinking water. Likewise, the area of the sector representing “Risk of flooding\/ forest fire” is the smallest (2% of the total area), the pie chart suggests that only 2% of times respondents said that they were concerned about flooding and forest fire.   A circular disc with wedges whose sizes correspond to those listed above labeled with the corresponding opinion.  Pie Chart representing the different neighborhood related issues that the survey respondents are concerned about.   A pie chart is usually drawn to graph categorical data. To create a pie chart,    First, create a frequency distribution table, where you will note how many times a particular category has been repeated. For example, question 2 of the \"Neighborhood welfare survey\" asked the respondents to indicate all the neighbourhood-related issues they were concerned about. The question provided the respondents with nine options. Each option would be considered as a category. Based on the responses, if you find that 200 responses have been collected, and 30 of them indicate lack of a proper waste disposal system, then the corresponding frequency would be 30. Likewise, if 20 out of 200 responses indicate respondents' concern about air pollution, then the corresponding frequency would be 20.     Neighborhood-Related Issues  Frequency    Lack of proper waste disposal system  30    Air Pollution  20    Access to Healthy Drinking Water  40    Lack of greenspaces\/parks\/playgrounds  12    Availability of healthcare system  28    Risk of flooding\/ forest fire  4    Access to grocery stores\/ neighborhood market  22    Unsafe road conditions  36    Others  8       Next, calculate the relative frequency of each category and their corresponding percentage. To calculate the relative frequency of each category, divide the frequency of each category by the total number of responses. For example, the relative frequency of lack of a proper waste disposal system = Likewise, the relative frequency of air pollution = .  To calculate the corresponding percentages, multiply the relative frequencies by 100. For example, the percentage corresponding to lack of a proper waste disposal system = .  That means, 15% of the times respondents expressed their concerns about lack of a proper waste disposal system in their neighborhood.     Neighborhood-Related Issues  Frequency  Relative Frequency  Percentage    Lack of proper waste disposal system  30  3\/20  15%    Air Pollution  20  1\/10  10%    Access to Healthy Drinking Water  40  1\/5  20%    Lack of greenspaces\/parks\/playgrounds  12  3\/50  6%    Availability of healthcare system  28  7\/50  14%    Risk of flooding\/ forest fire  4  1\/50  2%    Access to grocery stores\/ neighborhood market  22  10\/91  11%    Unsafe road conditions  36  9\/50  18%    Others  8  1\/25  4%                Finally, once the percentages are calculated, create the pie chart. Divide the circle into sectors, where each sector represents a category. The relative area of each sector must match the percentage of time a particular category has been selected. For example, since 15% of the times respondents expressed their concerns about the lack of a proper waste disposal system, the area of the sector representing \"lack of a proper waste disposal system\" is 15% of the total area of the pie chart. Refer to .     Bar graph  A bar graph is a visual tool that uses bars to compare data belonging to different categories. In the bar graph given given in , each bar represents the number of times respondents raised concerns about different issues in their neighborhoods. As the visualization suggests, 15 respondents expressed their concerns about lack of proper waste disposal system, 10 respondents expressed their concerns about air pollution, 20 respondents expressed their concerns about access to healthy drinking water, six respondents expressed their concerns about lack of greenspaces\/ pars\/ playgrounds in the neighborhood, 14 respondents expressed their concerns about availability of healthcare system, 2 respondents expressed their concerns about forest fire and flooding, 11 respondents expressed their concerns about access to grocery stores and neighborhood markets, 18 respondents expressed their concerns about unsafe road conditions, and four respondents expressed their concerns about other issues in the neighborhood that are not included in the list.  The important thing to know about a bar graph is that the longer\/ taller the bars are, the greater the values they represent. That means, in the given bar chart, since the height of the bar representing “Access to healthy drinking water” is the highest, you can conclude that most of the respondents, twenty to be precise, said that they were concerned about healthy drinking water. Likewise, the height of the “Risk of flooding\/ forest fire” bar suggests that minimum number of respondents, two to be precise, said that they were concerned about flooding or forest fire.   Bar graph of the neighborhood survey data. Image description available.  Bar graph representing the different neighborhood related issues that the survey respondents are concerned about. Image Description .   A bar graph is usually drawn to graph categorical data. To create a bar graph,    First, create a frequency distribution table, as in , where you will note how many times a particular category has been repeated or the given values corresponding to different categories. For example, question 2 of the \"Neighborhood welfare survey\" asked the respondents to indicate all the neighbourhood-related issues they were concerned about. The question provided the respondents with nine options. Each option would form one category. The survey response suggests that 20 respondents expressed their concern about access to healthy drinking water. Hence the frequency corresponding to \"access to healthy drinking water\" is 20.   Next, draw the two axes. Along the horizontal axis, plot all the categories, and along the vertical axis mark the frequencies.  Draw the bars for each category. Note that the height of a bar corresponding to a category is same as its frequency.     Histogram  Histogram is a visual tool used to explore the frequency distribution of quantitative data (both Interval and Ratio). The shape of a histogram decides if the data distribution is symmetric or skewed (right skewed and left skewed).  The histogram given in , represents the frequency distribution of the “annual household income”. In this histogram, the data has been used to create five bins of size $5,000 along the x -axis, and the frequency of responses has been recorded along the y -axis. The important thing to know about a histogram is that the taller the bars are, the greater the frequency they represent. That means, in the given histogram, since the height of the first bin is the highest, 20 to be exact, you can conclude that 20 respondents said that their annual household income is between $30,000 and $35,000.   Histogram of annual household income. Image Description available.  Histogram representing the frequency distribution of annual household income of the survey respondents. Image Description .   To explore the distribution of a quantitative data through a histogram, divide the quantitative data into ordered groups, otherwise known as bins, and count the number of data points that fall in each bin. For example, question 8 of the \"Neighborhood welfare survey\" asked the respondents about their annual household income. Thirty nine respondents responded to the question. The minimum recorded data is $30,000, and the maximum recorded data is $55,000. To create the histogram,   First, divide the range of data ($55,000-$30,000) into different bins of a fixed size (say $5,000). So, the bins would be, [30,000-35,000], (35,000-40,000],(40,000-45,000],(45,000-50,000],(50,000-55,000].  Next, create a frequency distribution table to count the number of responses that fall under each bin.  After the frequency distribution table is prepared, draw two axes. Along the horizontal axis, draw the bins and mark frequencies along the vertical axis.  Finally, draw bars from the lower value of one interval to the lower value of the next interval. The height of each bar should be equal to the frequency of its corresponding interval. That is, in the \"Neighborhood welfare survey\", if twenty respondents said that their annual household income is between $30,000 and $35,000, then the height of the bar corresponding to the bin [30,000-35,000] would be 20.     Histogram vs Bar graph  Although a histogram looks like a bar graph, there exists a fundamental difference between the two.   A bar graph visually represents categorical data (nominal and ordinal), whereas a histogram represents quantitative data.  In a bar graph, different categories are represented along the horizontal axis (if the bar graph is oriented vertically), and the associated values are represented along the vertical axis. On the contrary, in a histogram, the horizontal axis represents the different bins of equal length, and the vertical axis represents the frequency of data.  Since each bar in a bar graph represents different categories, the orders of the bars are not important, and there exist spaces between the consecutive bars. However, in a histogram, the bins are created to organize the quantitative data, so the bins are organized in ascending order, and no gaps exist between any two bins.     Box plot  A box plot, otherwise known as a box and whisker plot, is a visual tool that uses the five-number summary of a data set to look at the spread and distribution of data. The five-number summary of a data set includes its minimum value, lower quartile , median , upper quartile , and maximum value.   Boxplot of the income data. Image description available.  Box plot representing the annual household income the survey respondents. Image Description .   The box and whisker plot given in represents the annual household income of the survey respondents.  The box in the middle shows the inter-quartile range , which contains the middle 50% of the data. It means, 50% of the respondents said that their annual household income is between $31,000 and $40,000.  The lower and upper whiskers represent the bottom and top 25% of the responses, respectively. That means 25% of the respondents said that their annual household income is lower than $31,000 (lower whisker), and 25% of the respondents said that their annual household income is more than $40,000 (Upper whisker).  The line in the middle of the box represents the median. It passes through point $35,000 which indicates that 50% of the respondents said that their annual household income is more than $35,000, and 50% of the respondents said that their annual household income is less than $35,000.  There exists an outlier in the data set. One respondent said that their annual household income is $55,000, significantly higher than the rest of the responses.  To draw a boxplot follow the following steps:   First, organize the data in an ascending order. For example, to draw the boxplot of annual household income, first organize the incomes in an ascending order, with the lowest annual household income on the left and the highest annual household income on the right.  Next, calculate the median annual household income. The median is the middle number in a sorted data set. It divides a data set into exactly two halves, such that 50% of the data points are lesser than the median, and 50% of the data points are larger than the median. If the median annual household income is $35,000, that means 50% respondents' annual household income is more than $35,000, and 50% respondents' annual household income is less than $35,000\\}   Next, calculate the first and third quartile. Values that divide a data set into four equal parts (quarters) are called quartiles .  The first quartile or the lower quartile ( ) is the data point below which 25% of the data points, and above which 75% of the data points are located. If the first quartile of the annual household income data is $31,000, then 25% of the respondents' annual household income is less than and 75% of the respondents' annual household income is more than$31,000.  The third quartile or the upper quartile ( ) is the data point below which 75% of the data points, and above which 25% of the data points are located. If the third quartile of the annual household income data is $40,000, then 75% of the respondents' annual household income is less than and 25% of the respondents' annual household income is more than$40,000.   Diagram illustrating quartiles. Image Description available.  Figure showing how Quartiles split a data set into four equal parts. Image Description .   The difference between the third and first quartile is known as interquartile range ( ).  An outlier is an observation (data point), which is either too high or too low compared to the rest of the data points in a data set. For example, in the annual household income data set, the annual household income of $55,000 is an outlier. That means, the respondent having an annual household income of $55,000 is earning considerably high compared to the rest of the respondents who filled the survey.  The rule that is followed to identify an outlier in a given data set is called 1.5 x IQR. When a data set is given,   First find its median, upper quartile, and the lower quartile.  Next, calculate the value of interquartile range   Calculate 1.5 x IQR = 1.5 x    Find the fences:     Any data point beyond the fences, that is either lower than the lower fence or higher than the upper fence is an outlier.     Finally, draw a number line (horizontal or vertical) and use the five number summaries, minimum value, lower quartile , median , upper quartile , and maximum value, to draw the box and whisker plot.   Drawing of how to create a boxplot. Image description available.  Figure showing how to draw a box plot when there is no outlier. Image Description .   If there exists one or more outlier in a data set, then the rule will be slightly different. If there is an outlier on the lower side, then to draw the lower whisker join the lower quartile and the lowest non-outlier data point. If there is an outlier on the upper side, then to draw the upper whisker join the upper quartile and the highest non-outlier value.      Scatter plot  A scatter plot is a visual tool that is used to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables. In a scatter plot, the independent variable is usually plotted along the horizontal or -axis, and the dependent variable is usually plotted along the vertical or -axis.     Scatter plot representing the relationship between the number of household members of the survey respondents and their monthly grocery expenses.   The scatter plot given in represents the relationship between the number of household members of the survey respondents and their monthly grocery expenses . As the figure suggests, the variable number of household members is an independent variable (plotted along the -axis), and the variable \\emph{monthly grocery expense} is a dependent variable (plotted along the -axis). The scatter plot shows if there exists a relationship between the two variables, that is if the number of household members impacts the respondents’ monthly grocery expenses.  Scatter plots are drawn to explore the correlation between two variables. One variable (independent variable) is considered an explanatory variable, and the other is considered a dependent variable. For example, in the \"Neighborhood welfare survey\", respondents were asked about their number of household members and their monthly grocery expenses. If someone explores the possible impact of the number of household members on monthly grocery expenses, then the number of household members would be considered an independent variable, and monthly grocery expenses would be a dependent variable (depends on the number of family members). To draw a scatter plot,   Identify the independent and dependent variables.  Plot independent variable along the horizontal axis or x-axis, and plot the dependent variable along the vertical axis or y-axis. Label the axes.  Plot the ordered pairs (idependent variable, dependent variable).   Three types of linear correlation can be identified through the patterns displayed by a scatterplot.    If the increase\/ decrease in one variable indicates an increase\/ decrease in the other variable, then there exists a positive correlation between the two variables.   Points on a graph, lying mostly near the upward-sloping diagonal line .  Scatter plot indicating a positive correlation between two variables. Remix of      Negative correlation: If the increase\/ decrease in one variable indicates an decrease\/ increase in the other variable, then there exists a negative correlation between the two variables.

  "title": "Understanding the Issue",
  "body": " Understanding the Issue  In 1475, in the city of Trent, in what is now Italy, a two-year-old boy named Simon was brutally murdered. The body was found in the cellar of a Jewish family. A rumor quickly spread around town that the Jewish community had murdered the child and used his blood for their religious ceremonies. The local authorities of Trent rounded up Jewish members of the community, tortured them into false confessions, and executed some of them. Representatives from the Roman Catholic Church investigated and found no evidence of the involvement of any of the town’s Jewish community, but the local authorities convicted the community of the crime. Kristeller describes the rise of anti-semitic writing of poems and articles written about the incident that were printed in multiple languages in Europe . This spread of Simon’s story reminds us that “fake news” and the use of it to oppress minorities has a long history.  The scholars Lazer et al. defined fake news as “fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent” (p. 1094) . It’s information that looks like real news, but is not. These scholars go on to note how easily such misinformation spreads online where anyone can post information and it can potentially reach millions by being shared on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter.  When the misinformation is about whether or not a particular celebrity is romantically involved with another celebrity, the potential for harm is not high. But attempts at social justice can be thwarted by the spread of false or misleading information. One issue concerns which problems a given society faces. Is crime going up or down? If it is going up, then it is easier to convince people to divert public funds towards policing. If it is going down, perhaps such money could be spent on rehabilitation of criminals. A related question is whether or not police in a given area disproportionately kill people of color. If a problem does not appear to exist, it is difficult to build political will towards solving it. The same difficulty occurs with global climate change. Is the global temperature average increasing? Are humans causing it? Will it cause problems? If the public believes that the answer to any of these questions is “no” then the public will not support climate change abatement efforts.  The other side of this coin concerns solutions. Even if people have an accurate view of what the problems are, false information can make it harder to build support for workable solutions. For example, what are the effects of programs designed to reduce poverty? If misleading information is publicized that seems to show particular programs fail, then the public will not support those programs and the poorest members of our community will suffer more. Similarly, if proposed methods of reducing carbon emissions are inaccurately portrayed as failures, then such methods will not be adopted.  "

  "title": "Error Analysis",
  "body": " Error Analysis   Introduction to Error Analysis  Fake news is one type of “misinformation” or disinformation.” However, much of the “news” can be simply misleading. Some people or news outlets convey misleading quantitative information unconsciously; some do it deliberately. Researchers often present numerical results, and conclusions based on those results, without also putting forth enough effort to calculate and report the uncertainties and inaccuracies in those results. Perhaps more insidious, many professionals construct quantitative information to serve a pre-disposition, a political goal, or a business objective. What is an individual reader or consumer of this information to do?  One thing you can do is apply something called uncertainty and error analysis. This can be done informally as you read through a piece, but error analysis is also a rigorous mathematical discipline all to itself.  Let’s first consider a real-world situation in which uncertainty proved to be catastrophic. In 1985, the NASA spaceship Challenger, with the first civilian passenger, exploded shortly after takeoff. A post-mortem, or after-event, analysis was conducted and the NASA team struggled to explain what happened to the public, until Richard Feynman, a well-known physicist, dropped a rubber O-ring (something used to seal off an area) in a beaker of ice water and showed how the rubber became inflexible. It turned out that the failure of this O-ring was the root cause of the explosion.  The ability of that O-ring to hold up during the near-freezing temperatures during launch was an uncertainty which had propagated through to the launch event. It may have been the neglect of the NASA engineering team to think through all of the components and how they might fare under adverse conditions. It may have been that the launch team made a fatal assumption “in the moment” that the O-ring would remain stable enough. Whatever the deeper explanation, uncertainty surrounding that O-ring’s behavior at those temperatures led to a catastrophe. Uncertainty analysis, which is also more broadly categorized as risk assessment, is designed to flag such issues, especially for enormously complex engineering systems like a spaceship.  Now let’s turn to a error analysis as a discipline. Unless it is a highly theoretical treatment, most quantitative and numerical analysis begins with measurements of some kind. Temperature is a measurement. So is an answer to a question in an opinion poll. All measurements have error. Unfortunately, that error propagates through the analysis and the event the analysis supports, and can even get magnified.  Here is a simple example of how error gets magnified that also illustrates rigor: Suppose I want to calculate the volume of a large cubic concrete tank. Well, that’s pretty easy from a math perspective. The volume of a cube is the length of one side cubed, or , where V is volume and L is length. So, I just have to measure the length of a side. I take a tape measure and measure the side. Let’s say I measure it at 36 inches. There is an inherent inaccuracy to the tape measure; let’s say it is in. Oh, and did I make sure that the tape measure was completely straight and rigid from one side to the other? Maybe not. Maybe there’s a 1-inch error because of that. Or maybe I stretched my arms so far, I really only “eyeballed” the length.  Let’s assume there’s a total of 2 in. of error in my measurement. I calculate the volume as . Now, to report the error in this numerical result, I also have to concede that the length could be between 34 and 38. So the volume based on those two numbers are 39,304 and 54,872. Suddenly, that’s a pretty big spread!  Whether the error is significant or not depends on what you do with the number. The error could have a financial impact if you are buying the materials to construct such a concrete tank. The error could have little or no impact if you just need an estimate for something else.  The critical point is that the error in the original measurement has now been propagated and magnified in the final numerical result.  Now suppose I want to calculate the volume of the cylindrical fiberglass water reclamation tank I am staring at in my backyard as I write this. The equation for the volume of a cylindrical object is area of the base x height = volume and area of a circle is = Area. In this case, I have to make two measurements, height and diameter (diameter is twice the radius represented as r in the equation). I can measure the height with a tape measure, although that tank has been sitting there for 15 years so I’m not sure how much of bottom is under the gravel surrounding it. I can “back-calculate” the radius by measuring the circumference with the tape measure.  You probably can see where this is going. Two measurements, each with their own sources of error propagated and magnified into the final numerical result.  Now consider some numerical results with grave consequences. The forecasts for global climate change and its consequences involve some of the most sophisticated measurements and computer modeling humanity has ever devised. While it might seem overwhelming to consider the error in each of the measurements and how they are propagated, you can take comfort in the fact that thousands of researchers around the world are arriving at similar conclusions. Only a small percentage of scientists deny that human-induced climate change is advancing dangerously.  But here’s how politics come into play. Climate policy makers, and climate deniers, use a parameter called the “social cost of carbon” to “monetize” the effects of climate change. This is a very complex analysis. But realize that the Environmental Protection Agency in the Obama administration used a figure around $50\/ton carbon, while Trump administration officials revised the analysis and came up with a figure of around $7\/ton. How could such an important figure be so different? The answer is that the analysis involves several key assumptions. Change the assumptions and you can drastically change the result.  Many news reports containing quantitative results will give, at best, a cursory view of the error in those results. Journalists don’t have an infinite amount of column inches to devote to the story. Researchers often are limited by the number of pages they can publish for a journal article. But realize that every one of these numerical results has sources of error, often significant or even huge, and many of them will not be exposed. It is up to the reader to think through them.  So, one root cause of misinformation or misleading information is the error in the original measurements. Sadly, much of what we are presented as “information” is based on measurements which are not physical measurements, as in the examples above, but are data arrived at in various ways. If I want to understand public sentiment about gun violence, for example, I can commission an opinion poll. There are rigorous procedures for taking polls and then doing statistical analysis on the results. But statistical error is very different from, say, the biases inherent in the person formulating the questions for the poll.  Sadly, much news we consume is not even intended to pursue an “objective truth” (even as a direction), but instead is constructed to support a position. Consulting firms, government departments, policy shops, NGOs, and others spend or raise millions of dollars to generate reports which are consumed by elected officials, and breathtakingly reported by journalists, but that often amount to a string of assumptions wrapped around cherry-picked data presented in dazzling, colorful graphs (see next section).  Our message here is that fake news often has quantitative and numerical components to it, but you don’t need to know math or be a “quant type” to think a bit more deeply about those results. You do need to be a healthy skeptic, however, and simple “qualitative tools,” like error analysis, will help you.  In closing this section, it is important not to throw your hands up and say “all information is tainted, there is no truth.” “Facts” and “truth” are asymptotic, which means simply that we can get closer and closer even if there is always some doubt or “error.” Error and uncertainty, however, are compensated for as you consider the following “path” towards real knowledge and away from fake news:  Coincidence or randomness – one thing that happens (“I was assaulted in the park so this must be a high crime neighborhood”) or two things that happen around the same time (“my friend was assaulted in the same park the same week”) may constitute coincidence or randomness but not real information. Something similar can be said for a researcher or policy expert who reports results from an analysis or experiment that has not been repeated or validated by others.    Correlation – an association between two things (gun sales and violent crime, e.g., in a specific region) may show a weak or strong statistical correlation, or a significant association, which would have to be corroborated to constitute information you can rely on.   Causation – something caused by another thing (human industrial and consumption activity and global average temperature rises, as opposed to natural causes of those temperature rises) is a much higher bar to scale. This requires many independent and repeatable studies, perhaps coming at the problem from different directions.   Convergence – Specialists and experts collaborate and review each other’s work and begin to converge on a common “theory of the case” or explanation for why something is occurring.   Consensus – experts can gather in a room and nod their heads in agreement, but so what? Consensus among decision makers and their constituencies are then necessary for any action to be taken based on the information and knowledge.   Error and uncertainty in the information are progressively and incrementally reduced to low or insignificant levels as the analysis proceeds along the path of the “five C’s.”  Any one of these steps alone is insufficient. After all, the townspeople of Trent, Italy, achieved consensus around the fake news of the murder of Simon by the Jews in their community, and acted on the fake news. They did not withhold judgment until the “analysis” came out.    Error Propogation  Let's look at an example of how errors can propogate in a calculation, and how that can produce very different results in a calculation.  In May 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a non-partisan group which analyzes the cost of potential legislation, posted an analysis of a tax plan presented by the Republican Party . The analysis said that the tax plan, which called for tax cuts on wealthier taxpayers and corporations, would cost $4.6 trillion ( ) dollars over the next 10 years.  The mathematics that the CBO uses to make these calculations are pretty far beyond where we are in this class, but we'll focus on something else very interesting in this report. The CBO previously had estimated that the tax plan would cost $3.5 trillion dollars over 10 years - an estimate that was off by $1.1 trillion dollars - which is a huge amount. How could their estimate have been off by so much? And more importantly, which of these estimates is correct? A group which is in favor of the tax plan might want to use the smaller number to make the point that the tax cuts would not cost the government as much, while a group which is opposed could use the higher number to make the argument that their opposition is justified.  When we make estimates of something, there will always be some expected error - if it were perfect, it wouldn't be an estimate! For example, imagine I asked you to estimate how much money you would spend on food this week - the chances of you getting the answer exactly correct are pretty small. When we make mathematical estimates, mathematicians usually prefer to use a range of values - for example, a mathematician might say \"I'll spend $50-$150 on food this week.\" This is much more likely to be a correct statement than saying \"I will spend exactly $100 on food this week,\" since the correct value only needs to be in the interval!  If we give our estimate as an interval, half of the width of that interval is called the margin of error . In our example above, we would say that our estimate of food costs is $100, with a margin of error of . We can also write the interval as .  When we use estimates like this, the errors from multiple estimates can combine, a process called error propogation . For example, we know that . However, assume that we had an estimate of times an estimate of . Our values for range from 5 to 15, and our values for range from 17 to 23. That means our product could be as small as and as large as . When we multiply an estimate with a margin of error of times an estimate with a margin of error of , we get a margin of error of ! This error propogation explains why we can get such huge variation in estimates, especially when our numbers are large - even when our initial estimates are very good.  We'll look at a very simplified example of this problem to illustrate how we can get such large errors in an example like this.    Let's imagine a situation where everyone pays 10% tax on their income. A city wants to estimate the tax that their citizens will pay. They estimate that there are between 2.5 and 2.7 million people in the city, and that the average taxable income of those people is between $47,000 and $49,000.     Use the low estimates of the population and average income to calculate the lower end of the estimated tax collected.    We multiply the low end of the estimate for the population (2,500,000) times the low end of the estimate for the income ($47,000) times 10% (0.1). Our low estimate for the tax collected is 11.75 billion dollars.      Use the high estimates of the population and average income to calculate the higher end of the estimated tax collected.    We multiply the high end of the estimate for the population (2,700,000) times the high end of the estimate for the income ($49,000) times 10% (0.1). The high estimate for the tax collected is 13.23 billion dollars.     With error propogation, the more quantities we combine in our estimate, the greater the margin of error in our final calculation.   Consider a city now where, rather than everyone paying 10% tax, people pay between 8% and 12%. Repeat the calculations from with this variable tax rate. What are the low and high ends for your estimates now?   The low estimate is and the high estimate is   The estimated tax is now between $9.4 billion and $15.8 billion.     "

  "title": "Misleading Graphs",
  "body": " Misleading Graphs  Graphs can be a great way to display information in a way that helps people understand the relationships among numbers. For example, shows temperature changes over the last two thousand years. There is, of course, a lot of variation over time. Then, when we hit the Industrial Revolution, when carbon emissions increased substantially, and the line starts trending upwards very quickly.   Graph of mean temperature anomalies from last 2000 years. Image description available.  Graph of global average temperature change from year 1 CE to 2019. Image by RCraig09 from an original by Ed Hawkins, CC-BY-SA-4.0 .  Image Description .   Along the bottom, we see the years marked off in even increments. On graphs, the bottom line starting on the left and going right is the x-axis. On the left side, the temperature range is indicated. It shows the change in average temperature for each year relative to the temperature in the year 1 CE. That left side line with increments of some important variable is the y-axis. In some cases, the x-axis represents time and the y-axis indicates the degree of some phenomena. In other graphs you might see the x-axis as a causal variable and the y-axis as indicating some outcome. So, in the context of climate change, you might see a graph with the amount of carbon emissions on the x-axis and the average world temperature on the y-axis so the viewer can see how the two are related.  But because graphs appear to show objective truth, some people try to abuse that trust people have in graphed data to make things appear differently than they are. As a simple image, such graphs are easily shared online, sometimes with a caption indicating what the viewer is expected to believe as a result. There is a variety of ways to manipulate graphs, we’ll look at two. First, we’ll talk about truncating the y-axis. How wide of a range should you show on the y-axis? What should be the lowest value and what should be the highest? The question is: the y-axis range should go from what to what? In the case of counting things, you might expect the y-axis to range from zero to some plausible number for the most extreme case. But if you wanted to make something look like it was changing more over time you might include a smaller range in the y-axis, which we call truncating the y-axis.  Look at . It shows data from the Uniform Crime Reports from the American F.B.I. . There are plenty of criticism of the accuracy of these data, but setting aside those for a moment, we can use their data to see how to manipulate graphs. I have created a bar graph for the data about the number of murders in the United States in a way that makes it appear that murders went up a lot.   A graph in which there are two bars in a bar chart labeled 2018 and 2019 and a y-axis ranging from 16,340 to 16,430. The bar for 2019 looks much higher than the bar for 2018.  Graph of murders in the United States in 2018 and 2019.   But take a look at the y-axis. The lowest number is not zero, it is 16,340 murders in that year. Take a look at the graph in of the same data.   A graph in which there are two bars in a bar chart labeled 2018 and 2019 and a y-axis ranging from 0 to 18,000. The bar for 2019 looks only slightly higher than the bar for 2018.  A better graph of murders in the United States in 2018 and 2019.   In this graph, the y-axis runs from 0 to 18,000 murders. On this graph, it might even be hard to tell which year had more murders unless you zoomed in or looked at it really closely. To be sure, it is horrible that over 16,000 people were murdered in each of those years. But it seems absurd to argue that there is a big increase in murders when the graph with zero as the lowest point is used.  Let’s look at the same problem with a line graph showing change over several years. In this case, we are looking at the number of robberies in the United States over several years. shows the change over time in the number of Robberies in the United States, again graphed from F.B.I. data .   A line graph showing robberies in the United States with the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 on the x-axis and the y-axis ranges from 316,000 to 334,000. The line appears to show a rapid increase from 2014 to 2016.  Graph of robberies from 2014 to 2016.   Once again, it looks like robberies were really going up during that time. People seeing this graph might worry that if these trends continue, the streets will not be safe anywhere. They might start thinking about harsher penalties for crimes as possible solutions. But you have probably already noticed the y-axis here. The lowest point is 316,000 robberies, not zero. shows the same data graphed with zero robberies as the lowest point.   A line graph showing robberies in the United States with the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 on the x-axis and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 500,000. The line shows a tiny, barely noticeable increase from 2014 to 2016.  A better graph of robberies from 2014 to 2016.   Now it hardly looks like robberies are changing at all. They might have gone up slightly, but it is hardly a massive crime wave happening in 2016 that was not happening in 2014. With the graph in , would you want to devote a lot of public resources to stemming the rising tide of robberies? No one wants to be robbed, but it is not exactly a terrifying increase.  But some of you may have also started wondering about the x-axis. Where’s the data for 2017, 2018, and 2019? The F.B.I. had data for those years for murders in the last graph, where are they for robberies? That gets to the other side of manipulating graphs. Just like you can shrink the range of the y-axis, you can pick whatever range you want for the x-axis. Sometimes people call that “cherry-picking” the data. You only show the data in a graph that supports an argument you want to make and you exclude the data you want to hide. Once again, we’re looking at shady methods of trying to manipulate people. Take a look at , which shows the same graph as , but includes the later years from the report .   A line graph showing robberies in the United States with the years 2014 through 2019 on the x-axis and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 500,000. The line shows a tiny, barely noticeable increase from 2014 to 2016 and then a steady decline for each year after that.  A graph of robberies in the US from 2014 to 2019.   Someone who wanted to argue that the United States was becoming an increasingly dangerous place would be more persuasive if they presented , than . shows that there is a noticeable drop in robberies in more recent years after the slight uptick for a couple of years.  What counts as an honest graph that is not “fake news”? It is tricky to decide and a lot of it depends on the context. Consider the climate change graph back in . It had a y-axis that ranged from -0.5 C to + 1.0 C. For those of you more accustomed to Fahrenheit rather than Celsius, that’s roughly -1 F to +2 F. You may be thinking, only two degrees hotter? I would barely notice that outside, is this a misleading graph? The thing to keep in mind with this graph is the context. Scientists think that every 0.5 C increase has extremely important impacts on our ability to survive on this planet . Although it might seem like the graph is making a lot out of a little, it is probably a fair graph rather than a misleading one. It is important to consider the context when trying to judge where the y-axis and the x-axis should begin and end. Interpreting numbers always requires critical thinking about what is “a lot” and what is “a little.”  "

  "body": " Solving for Change  Some of you have been hearing your whole lives that you “shouldn’t believe everything you read on the internet.” But we believe that the skills in this chapter have helped you think through how you decide what to believe and what not to believe.  The section on error analysis focused on how easily small errors can add up to large ones and offered the Five Cs to help you decide how strong evidence is. At the low end of the Five C’s you can see how coincidence and correlation can easily contain errors whereas when you reach consensus, you have such a strong body of evidence from a variety of sources, errors are substantially less likely. So, when you encounter news that makes claims about what the problems are in our society and more importantly, what causes them, you can ask which C they are relying on to make this claim. You can also challenge others who try to argue for a claim with only the low C’s as their support.  Then we discussed how to avoid being tricked by misleading graphs in the news. Just because it’s a graph, it does not mean that the most obvious interpretation of the graph is correct. Always think about what a plausible range for the y-axis and the x-axis should be. Think through whether or not the difference shown is truly meaningful. Ask if there is more data in a trend that is not pictured to assess if change is really occurring or if it’s just a random shift over a year or two or among different groups.  We hope that these skills will make you a more informed consumer who will not be taken in by fake news either in the mass media or on social media. Just as the 15th century residents of Trent were moved by fake news to commit horrible crimes against their Jewish residents, the story spread throughout Europe and caused further bigotry and violence. The more people with the skills to stop the spread of fake news by refusing to share it and pointing out its flaws, the more likely we are to reach a more socially just world.  "

Objective: Understand the sources and consequences of error in a single measurement.   Method: Develop a method to measure the height of your instructor (teacher, professor, etc) and make the measurement. Use that measurement to make another measurement. Then use the second measurement in an equation.  Instructions   Split up into teams of two or more.  One team gets a tape measure. Another team gets a yardstick. Still another team gets a 1-ft ruler.  Agree on how you will measure your instructor's height.  Make the measurement according to the selected approach.  Now measure the length, width, and\/or height of the classroom using the instructor's height.  Calculate the volume of the classroom using the length, width, and height.  Compare the methods selected, the tools available, the individual measurements, and the result from the equation for the different groups.  Have each group identify the possible sources of error in the exercise and how they propagate.  Discuss the groups' results with respect to the five Cs explained in the text: coincidence, correlation, causation, convergence, and consensus. Which ones apply?  Extrapolate the findings to general sources of misinformation, misleading information, studies and research taken in isolation, etc.    Objective: Understand the assumptions which go into a \"forecast\" or a simulation, in this case an on-line financial calculator, and its purpose.   Method: Study the instructions, narrative, and results for an on-line calculator that forecasts\/estimates how you much you will need to save to achieve certain retirement savings goals.  Instructions:   Thoroughly review the material at this link: https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/investing\/retirement-calculator. Note: there's no need to download the app, just work with this page and see how the numbers change and, importantly, the colors adjust on the graphics  Identify as many of the assumptions used to \"build\" this calculator - some may be obvious, some may not. Hint: A \"default\" value is also an assumption. There are also hidden assumptions.  After reading thoroughly, go through the forms on the left and \"play\" with the numbers - record the \"scenarios\" you try by listing and grouping the values you use - age, pre-tax income, current savings, monthly savings rate, etc. You can think of the differences in the \"values\" you select in the same way as \"errors\" in the previous example.  See if you can identify the assumption(s) or defaults which have the greatest impact on the results  Contemplate why this calculator is available free of charge. What is the purpose of the company making this calculator available? Hint: Where does the \"Get started\" button take you?  Did you remember to hit the link at the very top in very small print, \"advertiser disclosure\"? And did you click on the \"list of partners\" at the end of the text box?  Discuss and defend whether you would classify this \"calculator\" as good information, misleading information, or misinformation? Or, is it independent\/objective 'content' or advertising? Is it \"useful\" content regardless of how you classify it?    Objective: Assess the validity of claims made in a public policy advertisement.   Colgate toothpaste was once fined for making the misleading claim that \"80% of dentists recommend Colgate toothpaste.\"   Read about the case that was made against Colgate. How was their claim true? How was it misleading?  How could Colgate have more accurately represented the results of their survey? Create an advertising statement that uses the same survey information you researched in , but is not misleading.  When you hear a claim like Colgate's, why should you be suspicious about it? What particular parts of the claim sound \"off\"?     In December 2021, the following meme circulated widely on social media:   Screenshot of tweet from Patrick Moore (@EcoSenseNow) which says \"You should get out more. Polar bears have increased 400% in 45 yrs. Whales are nearly fully recovered. Extinctions are down 90% past century (IUCN). Koalas doing fine. If we could ban wind turbines we could save 85,000 birds of prey\/yr in US alone\"  December 2021 meme attributed to Patrick Moore (@EcoSenseNow).    Evaluate the 5 claims made in the meme. Which are true and which are false?  What sources did you use to determine whether these claims are true or false? Why are these sources more reliable than the tweet?  Which numerical information in the tweet should have served as a clue that some of these claims were not true? Explain why those parts of the claim are a bit suspicious.     Another meme which circulated on Facebook in July 2021 shows an image of an electric car charging station, along with a claim about the miles per gallon (mpg) that the car charging will get.   Picture of electric car charging station, with text attributed to Laura Winckel, \"This is a picture of a car charging station that are popping up everywhere. This one is in Round Rock Texas.. Here's an interesting fact.... That 350kw generator uses 12 gallons of diesel fuel per hour, and it takes 3 hours to fully charge a car to get 200 miles. That's 36 gallons for 200 miles!!! 5.6 mpg\"  Facebook meme which circulated in July 2021, attributed to Laura Winckel.    The meme contains a number of quantitative claims, as well as a non-quantitative claim - that the station is running on a diesel generator, which is not true. What are the quantitative claims being made?  Which of the quantitative claims are true? Cite the sources you used to verify the claims.  What about these claims should make you suspicious?     An article in The Guardian on 07\/10\/2017 had the provocative headline \"Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, study says\"   Headline from the Guardian which states \"Just 100 companies responsible for 71% of global emissions, study says\" and a sub-header \"A relatively small number of fossil fuel producers and their investors could hold the key to tackling climate change.\"  Headline from The Guardian, 07\/10\/2017.    It is important to learn that a quantitative claim can be true, but still be misleading. Here, the claim that just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions is (up to some uncertainty in the exact numbers) factually correct - but it is missing some important context. Read through the article and do some research on your own. What do most of the companies listed in this study do? What kinds of products do they produce?  Based on your research in the previous problem, how is the author using the term \"responsible\" here? Do you agree that these companies are responsible for 71% of emissions?

What would be a better way to state the claim being made in the headline? Write your own headline which would present the same quantitative information in a less misleading way.     Method: Apply \"reverse quantitative analysis\" (RQA), or working backwards from the numerical result to assess the error, biases, assumptions, uncertainties, exaggerations, dramatization, etc.., to this headline: \"Social Isolation Is As Deadly As Smoking Up to 15 Cigarettes a Day,\" in a public policy\/campaign ad by Meals on Wheels ( ) to encourage viewers\/readers to donate money.  Instructions   First, from a \"math for the people\" point of view, what are the most important words in the headline?  Research this 'claim\" by doing as much searching on the internet as possible and write up your findings.  Ask yourself how do they define \"social isolation?\" How do they measure it?  Explain to yourself how they have arrived at this association between social isolation and smoking.  Apply the 5 Cs to this situation.

Choose a statement - true or false - that you would like to convince people of, and use the data to create a graph which would convince someone of that point. Explain why you chose to graph the data the way that you did.    Method: Find a flawed graph, indicate how the creator of the graph wants people to interpret it, and then discuss how it would be interpreted if the y-axis or x-axis were constructed differently.  Instructions:   In a previous class, ask students to bring in graphs they find online. Partisan news organizations are a good place to look.  Ask each student to show the class their graph.  For each, first ask the students as a whole the likely interpretation intended and then how it could be fixed to cause people to interpret it more accurately.    "

  "title": "Understanding the Issue",
  "body": " Understanding the Issue   What is gerrymandering? When does it happen? Why is it controversial?  Gerrymandering is the act of defining the boundaries of electoral districts to benefit a party or politician. Initial discussions of gerrymandering typically focus on the shape or geometry of districts, as these can be indicative of manipulation. How can the shape of districts affect voting outcomes, regardless of underlying population proportions? Consider the following example:   Basic gerrymandering example.   Images of various ways to divide 50 people into 5 districts. In one, blue wins 3. In next, blue wins 5. In last, blue wins 2.   The following clip from Washington Post provides an overview of gerrymandering in the United States that elaborates on the above images.     Gerrymandering, Explained (Washington Post).    Redistricting (in the United States) is the process of drawing new political districts (maps) every 10 years, as required by the U.S. Census. Political districts form the basis of our representative democracy, as each district corresponds to (at least one) representative in government, decided by elections among citizens living in that district.  Political districts exist at different levels of government. First, the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives each correspond to one district in one of the 50 states. The number of districts in each state is roughly proportional to that state's population, with the exact number determined by a mathematical algorithm known as the Huntington-Hill Method. As of the 2020 Census, the top six states in representatives are California (with 52), Texas (38), Florida (28), New York (26), Illinois (17), and Pennsylvania (17). Another six states have only a single representative (statewide district): Delaware, South Dakota, North Dakota, Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming.  Much like the U.S. Congress is divided into a Senate and a House of Representatives, state legislatures (governments) are also divided into two houses. (Note: Nebraska is an exception as they are the only state with a single-house legislature.) The number of districts in state legislatures varies by state, but is also subject to decennial redistricting to account for population changes and shifts. For example, Connecticut's State Senate has 36 districts and their State House of Representatives has 151 districts. The full listings of the number of legislative districts by state is available online. .  There are a few rules that all states must abide by when drawing their districts:  Districts must be roughly equal in population (\"one person, one vote\").  Districts must be contiguous (one connected shape).  Districts must comply with racial fairness via the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (see for more information).  Redistricting can be controversial due to who draws the lines in each state. While some states have independent redistricting commissions comprised of citizens or politicians equally representing the two main political parties, other states' processes are controlled by the political party in power of the state government. When in control, this incentivizes a political party to manipulate the maps in an effort to maximize their own future representation. The manipulation of drawing districts to benefit one group is called gerrymandering and will be explored mathematically and politically in this module.  "

  "body": " Cui Bono - Who Benefits?  In this chapter we will explore two types of gerrymandering: partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering.   Partisan gerrymandering is the practice of drawing district lines to maximize a political party's advantage in elected representatives. In this type of gerrymandering, voters and representatives of the party in power benefit as an increased delegation directly impacts the laws and policies that are able to pass in government, both on the state and national levels. On the other hand, voters and representatives of the party not in power suffer from being underrepresented in government and may be victims of a cycle where the opposing party maintains their power through the redistricting process.   Racial gerrymandering is the practice of drawing district lines to reduce the impact of racial minority voters by limiting their ability to elect candidates of their choice. This practice is illegal in the United States. Historically, in this type of gerrymandering, White people benefit from the drawing of districts that systematically stifle voters of color. On the other hand, people of color (POC) continue to be oppressed and are in a more difficult position to elect representatives to government that may fight for policies on their behalf.  "

  "body": " Big Problem: Using Mathematics to Determine Fairness   What is a fair district map?   Even without partisan bias, the notion of a fair district map may take on different meanings depending on your state and point of view. Perhaps a fair map is one that reliably produces representatives which are proportional to the state's political party populations. Maybe a map with a high number of competitive districts keeps democracy flourishing. Or possibly a state's geography prioritizes compactness of district shapes.  The good news is that mathematics provides tools to measure various forms of fairness in addition to ways to detect both forms of gerrymandering. We begin in by introducing compactness formulas to quantify the geometry of districts. Then in , we use a couple of different mathematical approaches to investigate partisan gerrymandering. Next, in , we unpack the ways statistics can be used to unveil racial gerrymandering. Finally, in we introduce the concept of outlier analysis as a way to identify unfair maps.  "

  "title": "Geometry and Compactness",
  "body": " Geometry and Compactness   As mentioned in the chapter overview, the term gerrymander originated from a critique of an unusual district shape in Massachusetts in 1812. Since then, many discussions about manipulation of district boundaries have focused on the shapes of the districts. Take a look at the shapes of some recent congressional districts, as presented in a Washington Post article :  Oddly shaped districts.   Collection of images of 6 different districts. The districts have squiggly borders and narrow regions spread over a wide area.  This is only a sampling of bizarre district shapes; in fact, some people even created a computer font called Ugly Gerry (see ) using real district shapes!  But what is compactness , and why should we care about districts having nice shapes? Compactness is a quantitative measure of a district's shape and how tightly packed, or compact, the region is. Remember that the function of a political district is to elect someone that represents the people, needs, and interests of an area. A district over a more compact area is likely to include towns and communities with similar interests, while a district that zigs and zags across a state is more likely to intentionally exclude certain groups of people and connect regions with different local interests. In fact, most states include language emphasizing the importance of compactness of their districts but lack a definition or a way to measure this characteristic.    Motivating Questions: To what extent can or should we use the shapes of districts to determine a potential gerrymander? Can we agree on an accepted way to measure compactness since many states specifically include it as a consideration for district plans?    Packing and Cracking: How drawing lines can change outcomes  Why might districts be drawn in squiggly shapes stretching over large areas? How can the shape of a district matter if we count all votes equally? Consider this brief introduction to two key terms: packing and cracking .   TedEd video introducing packing and cracking.

Three Ways to Measure Compactness of a District  There are many different mathematical and geometric approaches for measuring the compactness of a shape. It is important to note that these measures are based entirely on district shapes and do not factor in geography, racial demographics, political party affiliation, or election results. While the shape of a district alone is not indicative of gerrymandering, it can be worthwhile to consider as one potential indicator. We examine a few measures here.  To allow for more straighforward computations, we work in square grids in this section, noting that this is a simplification from real-life applications. We start with our square grid and a district plan drawn on the grid:  District plan on square grid.  Image of district drawn on square grid with edges following grid lines. Region encloses 18 squares and is an irregular shape.  Square grid with district plan.    We defined compactness above as a measure of how tightly packed a district is. The most compact district, then, is one that is as tightly packed as possible. If we are constructing our districts from squares in the grid, what shape would be as tightly packed as possible? We would want smooth edges, without any parts sticking out, so we might try to arrange our squares into a rectangular region. But a long, skinny rectangle would not be considered as tightly packed as possible: we could tighten it up even more by getting the side lengths to all be the same. Our most compact shape, then, is a square.  The first measure of compactness we discuss, the Polsy-Popper measure, is found by comparing the shape of a given district to the ideal shape, a square - more specifically, a square that has the same perimeter as our district.  The Polsby-Popper score is a ratio that compares the area of a district to the area of a square with the same perimeter as the district. Thus we have .  In the following example, we calculate the Polsby-Popper score for the district above.  Find the Polsby-Popper score for the district above in . Once you have the perimeter of the district (26), what dimensions would a square have with the same perimeter?      Omitting units and simply counting, we note the area of the district is and its perimeter is . Since all sides must be equal in length in a square, any square that has perimeter must have sides of length or . Therefore the area of this square would be . Now we find the ratio:    Our second measure of compactness, the Reock score , again compares the given district shape to a square. However, instead of using a square with the same perimeter as the district, the Reock score compares to a minimum-bounding square , which is the smallest square that fully contains the district.  The Reock score is a ratio that compares the district's shape to the minimum-bounding square, the smallest square that fully contains the district. We have .  In the image below, we show the district plan together with the smallest square containing the district.  District plan with minimum-bounding square.  Image of district together with outline of smallest square containing the district.  District plan with minimum-bounding square. The minimum-bounding square is outlined in dashed line. Because the district is 6 squares wide at its widest point, the minimum-bounding square is 6 units by 6 units.    In the next example, we calculate the Reock score for the district above.  Find the Reock score for the district above. As noted above, the smallest square that contains the district is 6 units by 6 units. Find its area.      Omitting units and simply counting, we note the area of the district is and area of the smallest square that contains the district is . In this case, we have .    Finally, the Convex Hull score is a ratio that measures how convex a district shape is. In geometry, a convex shape is one in which any two points in the interior of the shape can be connected by a straight line that stays inside the shape. If there is any pair of interior points connected by a straight line that partially falls outside of the shape, then the shape is known as concave . The picture below shows an example of a convex shape (image a) versus concave shape (image b):  Convex and concave shapes.  Image of two shapes. One has a line segment entirely inside the shape; the other shows a line segment partly outside the shape.  Convex and concave shapes.    The convex hull of a shape is the original shape together with the minimum additional area needed to make it convex. To visualize the convex hull, imagine placing a rubber band tightly around the perimeter of the shape. If the shape is a square, or a rectangle, the rubber band will fit exactly along the edges of the shape. If the shape is not rectangular, the rubber band will stretch across any gaps created between corners of the shape. This region enclosed by the rubber band is the convex hull. The picture below shows our district together with its convex hull:  District with its convex hull.  Image of district plan with convex hull, which has an outline like a rubber band stretched around the district border.  District plan with convex hull. The convex hull is outlined in dashed line, and can be thought of like a rubber band stretched around the district border.    The Convex Hull score is a ratio that compares the district's shape to its convex hull. It is defined as .  In the following example, we compute the Convex Hull score for the given district.  Find the Convex Hull score for the district above. The convex hull around the district is outlined in a dashed line. Find the area of this region by combining the area of the enclosed squares with the areas of the triangular regions formed.   .   Omitting units and simply counting, we note the area of the district is . The area of the convex hull that contains the district is found in pieces, combining the area of the squares with the areas of the triangular regions formed. For area of the convex hull we get . This yields    The actual formulas for these scores (based in the real world rather than districts composed of squares) vary slightly from those we use here. In particular, the ideal compact shape used for comparison in the first two measures is a circle. In the Polsby-Popper ratio, the ideal shape is a circle with the same perimeter (circumference) as the district. In the Reock ratio, the ideal shape is the minimum-bounding circle, which is the smallest circle containing the district. Our definitions and compactness scores are consistent with the formal scores and allow for more straightforward computations.    Compactness Criteria  In these three measures, compactness is a geometric measure that compares the area of a district to some ideal compact shape. In each case we consider, the compactness score is a number between 0 and 1 that measures the compactness of the shape relative to the ideal. Districts close in shape to the ideal shape (more compact) have scores closer to 1, while those less compact (farther from the ideal) score closer to 0. When a district has much greater perimeter than we would expect for the region's area (as happens when the shape has long, skinny pieces branching off or strung together), we may suspect gerrymandering. At this time, 37 states include a compactness requirement for state legislative districts, and 18 establish similar requirements for congressional districts. However, there is no universal measure, and different states have different laws that regulate compactness. In Idaho the redistricting commission is expected to avoid drawing distorted boundaries  , while in other states with extensive coastlines (such as Maryland) this is impossible. In fact, most states do not provide details on compactness measures but adopt a you know it when you see it approach in determinations.  Compactness in the Courts: Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district adopted in 2011 (shown below) has been widely cited as an example of a district that is far from compact as a result of gerrymandering. In 2018, the state's Supreme Court ruled this (and the rest of the district plan) to be an unconstitutional gerrymander, and required the state to create a new map.     PA 7th district, 2011 (\"Goofy kicking Donald Duck\").  Image of PA congressional district along with picture of two cartoon characters to which the shape has been compared.  PA 7th district, 2011 ( Goofy kicking Donald Duck ). For more on this district, see .   Among mathematicians and political scientists, the debate about best measures of compactness continues, but consensus has arisen around a few guiding principles:  There is no number threshold for a district being deemed compact - the numbers are used in comparison, not for their standalone values.  Compactness measures should be used across an entire districting plan, not just a single district.  Comparisons should be made between districts and plans within the same state, and not across different states as each state's geography is unique.  Compactness tests should measure the shape and not the size of the district.  Multiple compactness tests should be used whenever possible.  Compactness tests should not be the sole factor used to judge district plans.      Caution: Fairness Goes Beyond Geometry  We have repeatedly mentioned that geometry cannot be a sole measure of fairness, though many states do require it to be a consideration in redistricting. There are many different factors possibly contributing to a district's shape, as summarized in the following quote:  \"But sometimes boundaries that look odd at first glance just follow a natural geographic feature, like a river or a mountain range. Or they could be necessary to unite communities that live in different areas but share similar representational needs, like communities of color that have been subject to residential discrimination. Other times, odd boundaries are very much the product of gerrymandering. [...] The reality is that visual inspection can be a helpful, but ultimately very incomplete, analysis. It is a good first test that can help identify where a deeper dive is needed. In other words, don’t judge a book by its cover.\"   The Brennan Center has gathered several examples of situations like these in this useful analysis: Don't judge a district by its shape (opens new tab) . In fact, as the article points out, it is possible for a compact shape to be the result of a gerrymander too! In the following sections, we explore issues of fairness that go beyond geometry.   "

  "title": "Partisan Gerrymandering",
  "body": " Partisan Gerrymandering    Partisan gerrymandering is the practice of drawing district lines to maximize a political party's advantage in elected representatives. This can often be seen in states where the representatives by party are vastly disproportionate from the voter affiliations. For example, consider Pennsylvania's 2012 elections, the first statewide elections following the 2011 redistricting. Almost 58% of voters registered with one of the two major parties (Democratic and Republican) were registered as Democrats , but Republicans (who controlled the redistricting process) won 13 of the 18 House elections, just over 72% of the seats. This extreme difference led to a 2018 challenge in court and in League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania v. the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that this was a case of partisan gerrymandering that violated the state constitution and thus a new map needed to be drawn . Notably, the November 2018 elections using the new map yielded 9 representatives for each party, demonstrating the impact of the previous map.  Similarly, in North Carolina, a state whose votes are nearly evenly split between the two major parties (see the North Carolina Election Results Dashboard (opens in new tab) for specific information), the congressional plan was challenged due to the Republicans winning 10 of the 13 districts in the 2016 elections. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, who ruled in 2019 in Rucho v. Common Cause that the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering was not a federal issue and left it to states to decide. (For more information, see .) Following this ruling, a state court in North Carolina ruled in Common Cause v. Lewis (2019) that their map was unconstitutional and needed to be redrawn ahead of the 2020 elections. The new map immediately changed the outcomes as Democrats won 2 additional seats (5 rather than 3) in 2020.  Although these examples of disproportionality seem unfair, how can we determine whether the outcomes are a result of partisan gerrymandering or a reflection of some other factors? We turn to mathematics to help us explore this issue.   Motivating Questions: Can we quantify partisan advantage? Can we define a threshold for too much partisan advantage?   We look at two different metrics to answer these questions. Keep in mind that these metrics use only party affiliation and election results and do not consider geography or voter demographics, and note that there are other measures of partisan advantage.    Efficiency Gap  From our earlier examples, we know that maximizing representation requires a combination of packing and cracking strategies with the idea that one party's voters are best utilized through narrow wins and wide losses. The efficiency gap calculation is based on the idea of wasted votes :  If a party wins a district, any votes for that party above the minimum needed to win are considered wasted.   If a party loses a district, all votes for that party are considered wasted.   Following an election, we can determine the total number of wasted votes for each party (across all districts) and calculate the efficiency gap: This formula will produce a value between 0 and 1 and can be converted to an advantage in actual number of representatives through multiplying by the number of districts.   Consider the district plan given below. The symbols denote votes for either Heart party ( ) or Club party ( ).              2                                               1                             3                                                                      5                             4    Complete the table below, computing the wasted votes for each party in each district. Then compute the efficiency gap.    District   wasted   wasted    1        2        3        4        5        total          Since each district has 9 voters, the minimum number of votes needed to win is 5. Any votes over 5 for the winning party are considered wasted votes for that party. In District 1, the Heart party wins with 6 votes, thus the Heart party has 1 wasted vote in that district. All votes for the losing party in a district are classified as wasted votes.      District   wasted   wasted    1  1  3    2  4  0    3  4  0    4  1  3    5  1  3    total  11  9      in favor of Clubs ( ) since the Club party has fewer wasted votes    Each district has 9 voters, so the minimum number of votes needed to win is 5. Any votes over 5 for the winning party (in that district) are considered wasted votes for that party. In District 1, the Heart party wins with 6 votes, thus the Heart party has 1 wasted vote in that district. All votes for the losing party in a district are classified as wasted votes, so the Club party has 3 wasted votes in District 1. In District 2, Club wins with exactly 5 votes, so Club party has no wasted votes. Heart party, then, has 4 wasted votes. The computations for the other districts are done in the same manner.  To compute the efficiency gap, find the total wasted votes for each party, then use the formula given above. Since the Club party has fewer wasted votes, we calculate the efficiency gap from their perspective (subtracting their wasted votes from the other party's in the formula):     In the example above, we calculate that the efficiency gap is approximately . But what does that mean? Does it suggest gerrymandering occurred? What does the model consider to be fair ? If both parties waste the same number of votes, the efficiency gap would be . This is considered perfectly fair . The farther the percentage from , the more unfair the map. If we multiply the percentage by the number of districts, we get the advantage for the dominant party in terms of seats. In the above example, there are 5 districts, so the advantage for the Club party is districts seats. In the original paper introducing the efficiency gap , the authors defined a threshold for partisan gerrymandering as an advantage of at least two seats for congressional plans and at least 8 percent for legislative plans. Following that guideline, the district plan and election above do not show evidence of gerrymandering.  NOTE: Since its introduction, some shortcomings of the efficiency gap have been raised (see for some discussion). Importantly, it sets the vote split as the ideal outcome - but is that appropriate? The efficiency gap uses only wasted votes totals in its computation, without regard to how competitive elections were in each district or the geography of the region. Also, the +2 seat advantage is much more likely in larger states. How useful, then, is the calculation of the efficiency gap? As with other measures, note that it is one of many tools that could be used.    Mean-Median Difference  The mean of a set of numbers is also known as the average. We find this value by adding all of the numbers and dividing by the number of values in the set.  The median of a set of numbers is found by listing all values from least to greatest and finding the middle number. If there is an even number of values in the set, the median is the mean of the middle two numbers.  Let's find the mean and median of some sets of numbers. You are free to change the numbers and re-calculate as often as you wish.   The mean-median difference takes a statistical approach to measuring partisan advantage. If there was a lot of packing and cracking in a map, we would expect to see one party win many districts with just over 50% of the votes and lose a few districts with a small share of the votes. If we looked at the collection of these vote shares of districts as a set of data, we would expect the median to be higher than the mean. This skewness represents an advantage for that political party.   The following table gives the vote share by district for the Heart ( ) and Club ( ) parties.    district  Heart ( )  Club ( )    1  53  47    2  55  45    3  52  48    4  54  46    5  27  73    Compute the following:  the mean of the votes cast for the Heart party in each district  the median of the votes cast for the Heart party in each district  subtract to find the difference: mean median    To find the mean, add up all of the Heart district vote shares and divide by the number of districts. To find the median, list the district vote shares from smallest to largest and then choose the middle number.   mean = %  median = %  mean median     To compute the mean vote share, we add the vote share for Heart for each of the five districts, then divide by the total number of districts.   To find the median vote share for Heart, first we order the individual vote shares from least to greatest: . Then we find the number in the middle of the list - in this case, the third number: .  Thus mean median     We see in the above example that the median is larger than the mean. Is this a significant difference? Does it indicate that the Heart party has a meaningful advantage over the Club party? How do we decide? In (p. 1307), Wang proposes the following formula to compute the significance level, , in a closely divided state: We say that the difference between the mean and median is statistically significant and qualifies as partisan gerrymandering if . (Note: this threshold follows from a significance level set to , or , meaning that the likelihood of a value of above occuring by chance is or lower. The exact threshold varies depending on the number of districts; we follow Wang in using the value . For more discussion, see ).  Returning to our example above, we have (mean median) = and number of districts is . Using technology, we compute : Since , we conclude here that there is no statistically significant evidence of gerrymandering.    Caution  Because we could expect the mean and median to be close in a state that has not been gerrymandered, the mean-median difference produces a measure of skew between the two. The mean-median difference can help to identify district plans that are likely to have been crafted with partisan influence. The test for significance presented here is more effective in states where the vote is closely divided ( , with some discussion of this in ). Unlike the efficiency gap, this test does not indicate how many more seats the gerrymandering party won. We note here again that both of these measures only use party affiliation and election results, with no accounting for other factors that may be influential.   "

  "title": "Racial Gerrymandering and Statistics",
  "body": " Racial Gerrymandering and Statistics  Although the 15th Amendment in 1870 established that U.S. citizens cannot be denied the right to vote on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, it was not effectively enforced until almost 100 years later with the passage of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 in the Civil Rights movement. In the meantime, many Black citizens (particularly in the South) had faced tremendous obstacles to voting, including literacy tests, poll taxes, intimidation, and violence. The VRA now made it illegal for states to pass any laws that discriminate against racial or language minorities through vote denial or vote dilution. This includes anything that diminishes the ability to elect their candidate(s) of choice which would be applied to district plans and serves as the legal basis for racial gerrymandering .  Motivating Questions: Does racially polarized voting exist in a certain area? How can statistics help us decide?    In 1986, the Supreme Court case Thornburg v. Gingles (1986) further established what constitues an illegal racial gerrymander by adding a set of criteria known as the Gingles test :  a racial minority group forms a numerical majority of voting-age population in a compact geographic area  the minority group is politically cohesive (members of the group vote similiarly)  the racial majority group is also politically cohesive but for a different political party (their preferred candidate defeats minority group's preferred candidate)  The last two criteria are collectively known as racially polarized voting . If all three criteria are met, the law requires states to draw a majority-minority district in that geographic area. This means that the majority of a district's population are of a minority race, ethnic, or language group. These required districts are often referred to as VRA districts .   To determine if the conditions are met, ask the following questions:  Is it possible to draw a geographically compact district that includes the majority of the racial or language minority’s members?  Does the racial or language minority tend to vote as a bloc and back the same preferred candidate?  Does the remaining population also generally vote as a bloc and in doing so defeat the candidate backed by the racial or language minority?  Satisfying the first of the Gingles criteria requires analyzing maps and demographic data, and determining if racially polarized voting exists requires the use of statistics. In this section, we follow an approach similar to that outlined in .    Inference  Voting in the United States is done by secret ballot, so although we cannot know the votes of individuals, we can use statistics to infer the voting behavior of different groups based on election results in various precincts. In the following example, we consider two different voting scenarios that have the same aggregate data (i.e. the same vote totals).   Suppose a city's voting population is 55% White and 45% non-White, and suppose that in an election, a candidate from the Heart Party receives 60% of the votes and a candidate from the Club Party receives 40% of the votes. We can summarize this information in a two-way table as shown below.       voters   voters  totals    White voters  ??  ??  55    non-White voters  ??  ??  45    totals  60  40  100     The challenge is that due to the secret ballot, there are many possibilities for the inside of the table. Here we consider two different possibilities. For each table below, fill in the missing values. (Note that once we choose one value, the rest are determined.)        voters   voters  totals    White voters  45    55    non-White voters      45    totals  60  40  100           voters   voters  totals    White voters  30    55    non-White voters      45    totals  60  40  100      To complete the table, use the information on White voters who voted for the Heart candidate to complete the first row of data. In the first table, we have 45 White voters for Heart out of 55 total White Voters. That means there must be 10 White voters who voted for the Club candidate. In a similar way, fill in the other values in the table.         voters   voters  totals    White voters  45  10  55    non-White voters  15  30  45    totals  60  40  100           voters   voters  totals    White voters  30  25  55    non-White voters  30  15  45    totals  60  40  100       In the first scenario, when 45 of the White voters voted for the Heart candidate, we had 10 White voters vote for the Club candidate (since the total number of White voters is 55). Furthermore, since there are 60 total Heart voters and 45 of them are White voters, we must have non-White Heart voters. To complete the second row of data, note that we now have 15 non-White voters who voted for the Heart candidate and 45 total non-White voters, so we must have non-White voters who chose the Club candidate.  In the second scenario, we have 30 of the White voters choosing the Heart candidate. Thus we have White Club voters (total White voters - White Heart voters = White Club voters). Similarly, since there are 60 total Heart voters and 30 of them are White voters, we must have non-White Heart voters. To complete the second row of data, note that we now have 30 non-White voters who voted for the Heart candidate and 45 total non-White voters, so we must have non-White voters who voted for the Club candidate.    Notice that in the first table, , or , of White voters voted for the Heart ( ) candidate while only of non-White voters voted for the Heart candidate, suggesting that there is a significant difference in the voting patterns by racial group(s). The second table tells a different story: of White voters voted for the Heart candidate and of non-White voters voted for the Heart candidate. The closeness of these percentages suggests that there is no relationship between race and political party in this scenario.  Given that both of the scenarios above are possible (knowing only the vote totals), how can we determine potential racially polarized voting? First, we can analyze homogeneous precincts , precincts where the vast majority of people are of the same racial group. For example, consider a voting precinct in which of the voters are White and of the votes went to the Heart ( ) candidate in a recent election, as shown below.        voters   voters  totals    White voters  ??  ??  90    non-White voters  ??  ??  10    totals  95  5  100     In this scenario, there is a much narrower range of possibilities as we know that at least 85 of White voters voted for the Heart candidate in this precinct. (Why? Check: since there are only 5 total votes for the Club candidate, there could be at most 5 votes for the Club candidate that came from White voters.) That means at least of White voters voted for the Heart candidate, so it appears that White voters have a strong preference for the Heart candidate. We could then investigate precincts with a small percentage of White voters to estimate the vote choice of other racial groups.    Scatterplots and linear regression  Another statistical tool is to create a scatterplot with all precincts and perform a linear regression to estimate voter support by race. We can place the percentage of voters of a particular racial group on the horizontal axis and place the percentage of voters of a particular political party on the vertical axis and then the information from each voting precinct becomes a point on the graph.   The table below shows hypothetical data from the 15 voting precincts in a given town. For each precinct, the percentage of White voters and the percentage of votes for the Heart candidate are shown. Each of those pairs becomes a point on the scatterplot.    precinct  % White  %     1  80  72    2  45  55    3  64  69    4  78  65    5  50  47    6  59  57    7  61  62    8  35  46    9  41  52    10  24  32    11  52  60    12  28  42    13  46  60    14  37  45    15  55  60     Now we plot the points. Note that this can be done using any spreadsheet program. Click the Evaluate button to display the scatterplot.   Next we determine the line of best fit , a line that approximates the data points that we have entered. This is done through a process called linear regression , in which we find the line that minimizes the total distance from the data points to the line. We are looking for an equation of the form , where represents the percentage of votes for the Heart candidate and represents the percentage of voters in the precinct who are White. We use technology to determine the values of and . Here we use Sage, although any spreadsheet program is able to do the same analysis. Our code below follows this Sage tutorial by Brandon Curtis (opens in new tab) .   How do we interpret the output? In our example, we found and , so our line of best fit is given approximately by . In other words, We can use this to predict the voting patterns of each group. Suppose in a given precinct, 100% of voters are White. Then using our model, our prediction is that Now consider a precinct in which 0% of voters are White. Then using our model, our prediction is that In other words, we predict that the Heart candidate is the candidate of choice for 24.7% of the non-White voters. Do the White voters appear to be a politically cohesive group? What about the non-White voters?     Caution  Additional statistical analysis, including calculation of correlation and confidence intervals, can be done to further analyze the situation. We note again that all individual ballots are secret, so we are relying here on group totals (aggregate data) to draw conclusions about voting patterns of different groups. Technology tools are available to perform calculations, but any interpretation should be done carefully, with a solid understanding of the VRA criteria and careful consideration of the data used for analysis.

  "title": "Outlier Analysis",
  "body": " Outlier Analysis  In the previous section on partisan gerrymandering, each measure compared election results to some version of proportional representation, but in many states proportionality may not be the appropriate baseline.  Consider the recent history of congressional districts in the state of Massachusetts. As of 2021, Massachusetts has 9 House districts, all of which have been represented by Democrats for over 25 years. In fact, the last time a Republican represented Massachusetts was in 1994 and Democrats have won 125 consecutive House elections! Despite the lopsided nature of the state's representation, their map is not controversial and has not been challenged for any type of gerrymandering.   Why is this result not controversial? Republicans do exist in Massachusetts and regularly receive between 30 and 40 percent of the vote in statewide elections (President, Governor, Senate). Proportional representation would give Republicans 3 of the 9 congressional districts; however, even though the possible number of valid districting plans exceeds the number of particles in the universe, it is impossible to come up a plan that yields even one Republican district! This is simply due to the geography and the fact that there are no large Republican enclaves within the state. Due to the natural distribution of their voters, they do not form a majority in any region of Massachusetts , leading to their prolonged lack of representation in Congress.   Illustration of voting patterns in Massachusetts.  Two pictures of MA. In both, most regions are colored blue, with some red, orange, and yellow areas scattered around the state.  These figures are taken from (Figure 4). As described there, they show the voting pattern for Republicans George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential race (left, by town) and Kenneth Chase in the 2006 senate race (right, by precinct). Regions shaded dark red voted in favor of the Republican candidate, while regions in orange and yellow were the most \"Republican favorable\" available to collect enough population to create a congressional district. Even in assembling districts this way, the Democratic candidate would have won more of the vote share.    Motivating Question: If proportionality isn't necessarily an appropriate benchmark, what should we measure a district plan against? Can we determine if a plan produces an unlikely result?  One approach to take is to analyze a set, or ensemble , of possible district plans and see how a particular plan compares (on any metric) to those in the ensemble. If the plan in question is unusual relative to the ensemble, this may be due to a form of gerrymandering. An outlier is an observation that is unusual within a given context. In a large set of possible district plans, those with unlikely outcomes relative to the rest may be outliers, hence the term outlier analysis . There are many different criteria for determining outliers (or potential outliers) in statistics; we will not cover those in depth here.  Let's suppose a state with 7 districts has a proposed district plan in which the Heart Party is favored to win 6 of the 7 districts. A computer program generates 1,000,000 possible district plans and in only 100 of the plans is the Heart Party favored to win as many as 6 of the districts. Due to the unlikely nature of this outcome (occurring in only 0.01% of plans), there is evidence that the proposed plan may have been manipulated to benefit the Heart Party. That is, it represents a potential outlier.  Consider the following distribution of voters.                                                                                           Suppose we want to create 5 districts of 5 voters each. Some quick math shows the best outcome for the Heart Party (with 8 total voters) is to win 2 districts and it would take some intentional packing and cracking to achieve that outcome. In the example below, we create plans that lead to this outcome.   Draw district lines for the map given above so that the Heart party wins two disticts. Create 5 districts of 5 voters each.  Note that since there are 5 voters in each district, the Heart party needs at least 3 voters in a district to win the district. How can you draw the lines so that the Heart party wins two districts?                                                                                             Note that there are multiple possibilities! As an alternative to the plan given as the answer , we could also use the plan given here.                                                                                            While the Heart Party achieves their best possible outcome, can we say that gerrymandering is present? In other words, is the outcome of this plan an outlier relative to other possible plans?  We can look at this from a couple of different perspectives. We turn to technology to help us, using the MGGG grid tool found here: MGGG grid tool (opens in new tab) . It turns out that there are 4,006 ways to divide a 5x5 grid into 5 contiguous districts of 5 blocks each. The MGGG grid tool determines all 4,006 plans with the same location of voters shown here:  Voter distribution grid from MGGG tool.

As shown in the histogram, the Heart party wins 0 districts (seats) in 961 plans (24%), 1 district in 2,421 plans (60%), and 2 districts in 624 plans (16%). (Our event, the Heart party winning 2 districts, falls in the green bar to the right.)  Alternatively, there are 1,081,575 different ways to place 8 Hearts and 17 Clubs in a 5x5 grid. This time, we consider all of these arrangements with the same district plan given above in (the answer to ), shown here. (Different colors denote different districts.)  District plan matching .   District plan matching boundaries in . In the image, colors are used to distinguish different districts.  The MGGG tool provides the following analysis:  Histogram from MGGG tool of seat share won by 8 Hearts, given district boundaries.   Bar chart showing number of plans in which Heart party wins certain number of seats, given 8 Heart voters and a district plan.  In this case, the Heart party wins 2 districts in 120,450 out of the possible 1,081,575 plans, which is 11% of plans.  Either way, even though the Heart Party has maximum representation (2 seats), something happening more than 10% of the time is not all that uncommon. In research that uses statistics, 5% (1 in 20) is the most common threshold for determining whether an occurrence is considered an outlier. (Sometimes lower values such as 1% are used to capture only stronger outliers.)  Now suppose a ninth Heart is added to the district plan above (replacing any one of the Clubs). Mathematically, it is now possible for the Heart Party to win 3 districts, but even if they do, would it be considered an outlier and potential gerrymandering?   Go to the MGGG grid tool (opens in new tab) and scroll down to the section with bar graphs. Create a grid that matches , then change one of the Clubs to a Heart so that there are exactly 9 Hearts. Then create a district plan (using Build a Plan ) in which Hearts win 3 of the 5 districts. Observe the distributions to determine if your plan is an outlier.  The specific information depends on which square in the grid is changed to a Heart. Choose different possibilities to see the different results! As one example, place a Heart in row 5, column 5. This is shown below:  Voter distribution grid from MGGG tool with 9 Hearts.   Vote distribution grid from MGGG tool, modified from to have 9 Hearts. Plan drawn so that Hearts win 3 seats.  Then 38 plans out of 4,006 possible plans, or 0.9%, yield 3 seats for the Heart party, as shown in histogram below:  Histogram from MGGG tool of seat share won by 9 Hearts.   Bar chart showing number of plans in which Heart party wins some number of seats; reveals chance of winning 3 seats is small.  This outcome of Hearts winning 3 seats is an outcome occuring in less than 5% of the possible outcomes - in fact, less than 1% of possible outcomes. It appears to be an outlier when compared to the ensemble of all possible outcomes.   Although we can analyze all possible plans and distributions on a 5x5 grid, this is nowhere near possible with precincts on a real map. However, there are algorithmic techniques which can quickly generate thousands or millions of valid districting plans for the purpose of comparing a particular district plan of interest to an ensemble.

  "body": " Solving for Change   Let's return to our guiding question for this module: What makes a fair district map? We have learned some mathematical tools to analyze various components of maps: their shapes, the level of partisan advantage, the presence of racially polarized voting, and the concept of outliers to see how a district plan compares to other potential plans. The next step is to put all of these ideas together to create your own district plan and advocate for fair maps in a state!    Learn a state's redistricting process.  First, make sure you are aware of how the redistricting process works in a specific state. Here are some key questions:   Who draws the lines? (Is it the party in power, independent commission, etc.?) If an independent commission exists, who comprises the group? (How many people? Are they citizens and\/or politicians? How are they selected?)  Are there additional requirements or emphases in the state, such as limiting the splitting of counties or towns?  Are the processes different for congressional and state legislative plans?  What is required for a map to pass the state legislature? (Related: What is the current balance of power in the state government?)  Does the governor have veto power over district plans?  Is there a history of gerrymandering in the state?   Two excellent resources for answering these questions are Ballotpedia's pages on redistricting procedures and All About Redistricting , run through Loyola (Marymount) Law School.    Use a redistricting mapping program (website) to draw a \"fair\" map for a state.  Dave's Redistricting and DistrictR are free, user-friendly, and powerful online tools designed specifically for the purposing of redistricting. Key features common to both tools include:  the actual 2020 U.S. Census data  tracking population and deviation from ideal while drawing districts  viewing demographic information across your districts  viewing voting history across your districts  checking for contiguity of your districts  checking for (and zooming to) any unassigned population areas  viewing the existing district plans (congressional and legislative)  editing with multiple people (at the same time)  exporting to other file types, including .csv and .json   Additional features (as of September 2021) in Dave's Redistricting include:   editing district plans at the block level (smallest possible Census unit)  computing Polsby-Popper and Reock compactness scores  computing the efficiency gap, mean-median difference, and other partisan bias measures  creating a scatterplot and regression to look for racially polarized voting  comparing metrics across different district plans    Learn about ways you can get involved  Many states have opportunities for public input and transparency in their process. This can include electronic portals to submit full or district plans or to identify a community of interest, public hearings on proposed plans, and the ability to legally challenge approved plans. In addition, advocacy groups such as Common Cause and FairVote , along with local groups, can help to amplify and mobilize voices and provide information to the public and media.     "

When using grid examples, it is often easy for populations to be equal in every district, but on real maps, some deviation is allowed. The population deviation of a district plan is the percentage difference between the most populous and least populous districts, relative to the ideal population (the population if all districts were equal).  For example, suppose a state with 1,000,000 people was divided into 10 districts. The most populous district contains 102,300 people and the least populous district contains 98,400 people. This means that the ideal population is 100,000 and the population deviation is 3.9%.   Courts have dictated that the maximum allowed population deviation is 0.75% for congressional plans and 10% for state legislative plans.   Suppose a state is planning to create new congressional districts and proposes a plan in which their 3 districts have the following populations:   District #1: 232,934  District #2: 231,956  District #3: 231,158   Calculate the ideal population and the population deviation for this plan. Would this proposal be allowed to move forward based on population alone?  Suppose a state with a population of 2,300,000 is set to create new district plans for 8 congressional districts and 40 state legislative districts  The congressional proposal's least populous district has a population of 286,790. What is the maximum population allowed for another district?  The state legislative proposal's most populous district has a population of 59,440. What is the minimum population allowed for another district?       The grid below represents a districting plan.    Calculate the Reock score for each district.   Calculate the Polsby-Popper score for each district.   Calculate the Convex Hull score for each district.    For each statement, explain why the statement is not an appropriate interpretation of compactness scores.  The average Polsby-Popper score of districts in Maryland is 0.115, thus the districts are not compact.  The Reock score of Massachusetts' 6th district is 0.45 while the Reock score of its 5th district is 0.23, thus the 6th district is more compact.  The average Polsby-Popper score of New Jersey's congressional districts is 0.20 while the average Polsby-Popper score of Pennsylvania's congressional districts is 0.33, thus Pennsylvania is more compact.

Which party holds the advantage in this plan? How significant is their advantage?     There is an alternative shortcut formula to calculate the efficiency gap in a districting plan:  Efficiency Gap = (% of Districts won 50%) 2 * (% of Votes 50%)  For example, in the district plan in Example 1.6.1 (given in ), Heart wins 3\/5 = 60% of districts and has 26\/45 = 57.8% of voters.  Using the formula: Efficiency Gap = (60% 50%) 2 * (57.8% 50%) = %. Since we used values for Heart, the negative number here represents that the Club party holds the advantage in this map.   Note: This answer is slightly different from the original calculation due to rounding error and the fact that our grid districts needed at least 5\/9 = 55.6% of voters to win (rather than 50% +1 vote).   Use this alternative formula to calculate and interpret the efficiency gap in . Are your answers close?  Suppose a party has 60% of votes on an entire map. The most fair outcome according to the efficiency gap formula is that this party wins what percentage of districts? What does your answer tell you about the efficiency gap formula and proportionality?     Efficiency Gap and Mean-Median   The tables below show the results of the North Carolina congressional elections in 2018 (prior to the state ruling that partisan gerrymandering is illegal, forcing a new map to be drawn and used) and 2020. For purposes of calculations, assume that an equal number of people voted in each district. NOTE: Do not include the 100-0 districts in the calculations as candidates ran unopposed, so it does not make sense to say votes are wasted when voters did not have a choice on candidates.      Calculate and interpret the efficiency gap for each set of election results. Does either district plan give more than a +2 seat advantage to the Republicans? (Reminder: Do not include the 100-0 districts in the calculations.)      Calculate and interpret the Mean-Median Difference for each set of election results. Do the elections show a significant partisan bias to the Republicans under each district plan? (Again, do not include 100-0 districts in the calculations.)

If the election outcome (seats) is proportional to voter party (votes), what number will the seats-to-votes ratio be close to?       Racial Gerrymandering Exercises     Suppose a voting precinct has White voters and in a recent election, of voters in the precinct supported a Heart ( ) party candidate. What is the maximum and minimum percentage of White voters that could have voted for the Heart candidate in the district? Complete the tables below.     maximum White for        votes   votes  total    White      80    non-White          total  75    100        minimum White for        votes   votes  total    White      80    non-White          total  75    100     maximum White for   minimum White for       Suppose a voting precinct has Hispanic voters and in a recent election, of voters in the precinct supported a Heart ( ) party candidate. What is the maximum and minimum percentage of Hispanic voters that could have voted for the Heart candidate in the precinct? Complete the tables below.     maximum Hispanic for        votes   votes  total    Hispanic      68    non-Hispanic          total  36    100        minimum Hispanic for        votes   votes  total    Hispanic      68    non-Hispanic          total  36    100     maximum Hispanic for   minimum Hispanic for       Suppose we collected data from all precincts from the scenarios in the previous exercise, then created a scatterplot and found the line of best fit.   We obtain the following regression line equation for the relationship between White voters and Heart voters among precincts in a district: Using the equation above, what percentage of votes would you predict that Heart would receive from a precinct with all White voters?    We obtain the following regression line equation for the relationship between Hispanic voters and Heart voters among precincts in a district: Using the equation above, what percentage of votes would you predict that Heart would receive from a precinct with all Hispanic voters?    Do the answers above suggest racially polarized voting among White and Hispanic voters in this particular district? Explain.     Use the MGGG 5x5 grid interactive tool (opens new tab) to answer the following questions.   Place 9 Hearts in the center of the grid and 16 Clubs around the outside. Given that there are 5 districts of 5 voters each, do you think it is more likely that Hearts wins 0 districts or 3 districts? Test this by creating an example of each scenario and comparing the bar graphs of results.  Now place 9 Hearts on the border of the grid and use Clubs for the remaining 16 positions. Does this position of Hearts make it easier or harder for them to win districts compared to clustering them in the center (in the previous question)? Use the bar graphs to support your answer.     Use the MGGG 7x7 grid interactive tool (opens new tab) to answer the following questions. Even though the 7x7 grid is only roughly double the amount of spaces as a 5x5 grid, the number of possible district plans vastly increases. While it might not be practical to consider all possibilities, we can use the grid simulation to take a sample of possible district plans and obtain a distribution of results (similar to the previous exercise) among the sample.   Create a valid district plan (7 districts of 7 voters each) with exactly 22 Hearts in which Hearts wins 4 out of 7 districts. Is your plan an outlier for the distribution of voters that you chose? Use the sample with MCMC button to create a bar graph of results. What happens when you change nothing on your district plan but click the sample button again?  Change your district plan by changing 4 Hearts to Clubs which do not change the outcome of any district. You should now have exactly 18 Hearts and a plan in which Hearts wins 4 out of 7 districts. Is your plan an outlier for the distribution of voters that you chose?  Create multiple grids of exactly 18 Hearts but arrange the Hearts in different ways. For example, you might arrange them together in one large group, in two groups in opposite corners, or randomly scattered in the grid. For each arrangement, create the distribution of districts won by Hearts. Are there certain arrangements of the 18 Hearts that tend to result in winning more districts?     "

  "body": "When using grid examples, it is often easy for populations to be equal in every district, but on real maps, some deviation is allowed. The population deviation of a district plan is the percentage difference between the most populous and least populous districts, relative to the ideal population (the population if all districts were equal).  For example, suppose a state with 1,000,000 people was divided into 10 districts. The most populous district contains 102,300 people and the least populous district contains 98,400 people. This means that the ideal population is 100,000 and the population deviation is 3.9%.   Courts have dictated that the maximum allowed population deviation is 0.75% for congressional plans and 10% for state legislative plans.   Suppose a state is planning to create new congressional districts and proposes a plan in which their 3 districts have the following populations:   District #1: 232,934  District #2: 231,956  District #3: 231,158   Calculate the ideal population and the population deviation for this plan. Would this proposal be allowed to move forward based on population alone?  Suppose a state with a population of 2,300,000 is set to create new district plans for 8 congressional districts and 40 state legislative districts  The congressional proposal's least populous district has a population of 286,790.

  "title": "Understanding the Issue",
  "body": " Understanding the Issue  The earth's climate is constantly changing, with periods of warming and cooling alternating throughout history and prehistory. Scientists are able to measure the earth's climate by using temperature records for the last roughly 150 years, and using reconstruction from ice cores and seafloor cores before that. There are many factors that cause the earth's climate to change, including changes in the sun, changes in the tilt of the earth's axis, meteorites, volcanos, and changes in vegetation . Some of these changes, like changes in the sun or the tilt of the earth's axis, happen slowly over millions of years and cause similarly slow changes in climate.  Rapid changes in climate tend to be caused by natural disasters, like volcanic eruptions. These changes tend to be small and localized, unless the natural disaster is cataclysmic - like the event, theorized to be caused by a meteor strike in the Yucatan peninsula, which caused the extinction of many dinosaurs between the Cretaceous and Paleogene periods. This event caused a global temperature drop of  . Changes in climate due to cataclysmic events - even like the one which caused the last mass extinction before modern times - tend to be temporary. That severe cooling event only lasted for 3-4 years.  The world is currently experiencing such a cataclysmic rise in global temperatures. While the global temperature has been higher in the past - for example, during the Cretaceous period - there is no evidence that the world has experienced such a rapid warming period over the past million year . Global temperatures have risen by C since records started in 1880, with 2\/3 of that warming coming since 1975 - indicating that warming is accelerating . Projections indicate that the globe could warm by in the 21st century alone .  Unlike past changes to the climate, the current change is driven almost entirely by the actions of a single species - ours. As early as the 1820s, the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier realized that the Earth's atmosphere must trap some of the sun's warmth - otherwise the Earth would be as cold as the moon . In 1859, the Irish physicist John Tyndall proved in a laboratory setting that certain gases - including water vapor ( ), carbon dioxide ( ), and methane ( ) - were trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. In 1896, a Swedish physicist, Svante Arrhenius, who was studying carbon dioxide levels during the current time and during the last ice age, coined the term greenhouse effect  .   The Greenhouse Effect  The greenhouse effect refers to the way that certain gases, primarily water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone, trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere. These four gases are commonly called greenhouse gases .   The greenhouse effect is not, in and of itself, a bad thing. In fact, without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be a lifeless shell. The moon receives essentially the same solar energy as the Earth, but its surface temperatures swing between F ( C) during the day to F ( C) at night . The greenhouse effect traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, releasing it more slowly, and creates a temperature range where life can exist. The Earth's natural cycles and processes cause many slow, gradual changes to these greenhouse gases, resulting in slow, gradual fluctuations in the Earth's temperatures.  The current global warming is being driven by a very rapid increase in the amount of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This increase can be explained primarily by human changes to the planet - the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture. As human beings produce more of these greenhouse gases, the global climate has warmed at a corresponding rate. The corresponding changes to the Earth's climate are called anthropogenic climate change .   Anthropogenic Climate Change  Anthropogenic climate change is change to the Earth's climate resulting from human causes, as opposed to climate change caused by natural causes, like volcanic eruptions, natural fluctuations in greenhouse gases, or changes to solar energy.   There are actually several different types of human activity which can cause changes to climate, aside from greenhouse gas emissions. One example is human-caused changes to the Earth's albedo - the lightness or darkness of the Earth's surface. Lighter colored materials tend to reflect more sunlight, causing a cooling effect, while darker colored materials tend to absorb more sunlight. Human activity has caused some areas of the Earth's surface to become darker, like urban areas and areas which were once covered in snow and ice, and thus to absorb more heat. We have also caused other areas to become lighter, like forests that have been replaced by fields and areas which have become desert, creating a cooling effect (like the moon, deserts tend to be very hot during the day and very cold at night).  The amount of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions, though, vastly outweighs all other sources. The amount of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere has, in the last 100 years, risen to levels not seen in the last 400,000 years.    Graph showing atmospheric co2 over the last 400,000 years. Image description available.  Atmospheric CO2 levels for the past 400,000 years. Image Description .     This unprecedented rapid change to greenhouse gas levels has caused a corresponding rapid increase in global temperatures. While the Earth's biosphere (a collective term for all life on the planet, including plants, animals, and all other organisms, and the environments that support that life) has survived changes of similar magnitude in the past, those changes have been much slower. The natural processes of evolution which allow life to adapt to climate changes tend to happen slowly, over many generations. So, while some species with very short life-cycles (like bacteria, or even insects) may be able to adapt to the changes through evolution, longer-lived species will only be able to survive by moving to another area. Scientists estimate that 95% of species will experience local extinction (meaning either extinction or departure from that area) after a C risee in temperatures, and that 16-30% of species could go extinct by 2070 .  While human beings are unlikely to go extinct - our intelligence has made us more adaptable than other species - climate change has already begun to affect our species. Research has shown that production of the 10 largest crops in the world has already dropped by 1% since 1974 below where it would be without the impact of climate change . The United Nations High Commission on Refugees estimates that between 2008 and 2019, there were over 21.5 million displacements of people - when an individual was forced to flee their home - caused by weather-related events, more than twice as many as those caused by conflicts or violence . The same data shows that climate disasters like droughts, cyclones, and floods can have destabilizing effects on countries, especially those already experiencing conflict, like Afghanistan, Yemen, and Mozambique.  Climate change - and the greenhouse gas emissions which are driving that change are a major concern for people around the world. The need to find solutions to this crisis becomes more urgent with every passing year. Mathematics can help us to understand the causes of the greenhouse effect and to determine the best strategies for slowing - and one day stopping - the pace of climate change.  "

  "body": " Cui Bono - Who Benefits?  The unfortunate reality of climate change is that we all benefit - the quality of life which we have is largely due to the cheap availability of fossil fuels. We can get around easily with cars, fly (relatively) cheaply when we go on vacation, eat the food that we want, and buy all of the things that we want. All of the things that we do produce greenhouse gases, at some level.  Some individuals, though, benefit more than others. The corporations that produce the goods we buy - our cars, plastics, electronics, and food - are motivated to keep selling more stuff, even if that stuff produces greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies make money by extracting and selling fossil fuels like coal, natural gas, and petroleum. All of this economic activity contributes to government tax revenues, which allows politicians to spend more money on their constituents and special interests.  In short, unless you live in a cabin in the woods, grow all of your own food, and use energy only from zero-emissions sources (even a campfire generates greenhouse gases), you're benefiting from greenhouse gas emissions. If you own a car company or an oil company (or have stock in them), you're benefiting a lot more.  "

  "body": " Scientific Notation and Number Sense   Thinking about Size Comparisons  How can we compare the numbers 100 and 1,000?  Answers you might have given:  1,000 is 900 more than 100.  100 is 900 less than 1,000.  100 is 1\/10 as big as 1,000.  1,000 is 10 times as big as 100.     Reflection question: Look at the different ways of comparing those two numbers. What are the benefits of each of these comparisons? What are some reasons for not using some of these comparisons? Why might someone choose to use one way of comparing instead of another?   How can you compare the following sets of numbers?  1,000,000,000,000 and 10  545,430,089,384,398,938,938,398,983,982,345,523,234,942 and 9,293,983,983,298,982,983,483  0.0000000001 and 10,000,000,000,000,000    You can compare these numbers in the same ways as the ways you might have chosen to compare 100 and 1000, but they may not be as meaningful or useful. Instead, you might want to see Can you think of any other ways to compare these numbers?    Powers of Ten is a (slightly outdated) movie from the 1970s which shows how the different powers of ten are related.   Understanding very large numbers can be hard to do. Some strategies for trying to understand very large numbers are:   Breaking the number down into smaller pieces. For example, say you were trying to understand the number $1,000,000,000 (1 billion dollars). If you made $100 an hour, and you worked full-time (40 hours per week in the US), 50 weeks a year, it would take 5000 years for you to earn $1,000,000,000...and that doesn't even account for taxes!   Changing the units of the number can be helpful, especially when there is another unit which might help you understand better. The Aqua satellite, used to measure greenhouse gas emissions, orbits 2,300,000 feet above the Earth. This large number is easier to comprehend if you convert it into 436 miles   Comparing the quantity to something else you already can envision. The 2,300,000 feet or 436 miles we found in the previous bullet is still somewhat difficult to understand. Thinking of this as the distance from Washington D.C. to Boston, or from San Diego to San Jose, can be more helpful (at least if you've been to those cities).  Looking at the quantity per person, or per unit area, or per some other unit. In 2020, the US used 763 million gallons of oil, on average, every day . That is a little bit more than 2 gallons per person.     What is Scientific Notation?  So far, we have been writing numbers using decimal notation. Decimal notation is our usual way of writing the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 to talk about a number. But, sometimes decimal notation can make it more difficult to understand really big or really small numbers. Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in order to make the numbers easier for people to understand. Scientific notation also makes it easier to write down numbers that would be very long in decimal notation.   Scientific Notation  We say a number is in scientific notation if it is written in the form where A is the first non-zero digit in the number, and power is the appropriate power.   To put a number into scientific notation, we first figure out what the place is of the first nonzero digit. Each place in a number corresponds to a power of 10 - for example, the hundreds place corresponds to , while the millions place corresponds to . If , then is a 1 followed by 0s. The ones place is .  For negative values of , we get decimals. For example, , one-tenth. , one one-thousandth.  To do arithmetic with numbers in scientific notation, you proceed differently depending on what you're doing.   To multiply\/divide numbers in scientific notation, you can divide both the decimal part and the exponent part separately.   To add or subtract numbers in scientific notation, you'll need to write them both with the same power (use whichever power is larger), and then add or subtract the decimal parts.   If you end up with a zero in front of the decimal, you'll need to move the decimal place over one or more places:    Try this yourself in the examples below. Don't worry about rounding - we'll talk about how to decide how many decimal places to round to in the next section.   Find the product of and .       Find the sum of and .        Significant figures  When working with numbers with lots of decimal digits, how many digits should you keep? This is the idea behind signficant figures .   Significant Figures  The number of significant figures or significant digits in a number which has been rounded is the total number of digits written, minus any leading zeros (zeros written before the first non-zero digit). Numbers that have not been rounded have an infinite number of significant figures.   For example, the number 123.4567 has 7 significant digits, but so does the number 0.0001234567. The number 1.234567000 has 10 significant digits, because we count the zeros which aren't leading zeros.   The population of the United States was 328,239,523 in 2019 . How many significant digits does this number have?   There are 9 significant digits here.    In a number written in scientific notation, we count the significant digits the same way. For example, the number has 5 significant digits (notice that this is the same as if we had written it as ).    The United States emitted the equivalent of metric tons of carbon dioxide in greenhouse gases during 2019 . How many significant figures are there in this number?    There are 4 significant figures.    Significant figures are important because they tell us how accurate numbers are. Say we wanted to know what the average CO2 emissions per person were in the United States. We can take the numbers we had in the last two examples and divide: The calculator produces a number of digits here, but how can we know how many values to round to? Significant figures give us a way to decide this.   When multiplying or dividing two numbers, round to the smaller number of significant digits.  When adding or subtracting two numbers, round to the smaller number of decimal places (significant figures after the decimal point).   For our example above, since the population number has 9 significant digits, and the CO2 emissions only has 4, we will round to 4 decimal places and say that the emissions per person is metric tons per person. Compare this to what we do when we subtract.  Say we want to know how many more tons of CO2 equivalents per person were emitted in the US than in China. In 2019, China had (5 significant figures) of CO2 equivalent emissions , and the population was 1,433,783,686 (10 significant figures) . So in China, the emissions per person were Since we're dividing, we keep 5 significant figures and get tons of CO2 equivalent emissions per person. If we want to know how many more tons are emitted per person in the US, we subtract: Since we are subtracting, we take the lesser of the significant figures after the decimal - 2 in this case. So we round the answer to 10.02 metric tons more per person.  What’s that big ‘E’ on my calculator? You’ve probably seen an output like this before on your calculator.  The second line might look really complicated, but this is just the way your calculator was programmed to write numbers in scientific notation. The product of 315,246 and 134,512,361 is too big to fit all of it on the calculator screen in one line. So, the calculator programmers decided to represent that product using scientific notation. 4.240448376E13 means the same thing as .  But, not all calculators use ‘E’ to describe very large or very small numbers. Desmos provides an online scientific calculator that anyone can use. If you try to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers with more than 9 digits, Desmos will automatically write them in scientific notation. Instead of using the capital E, Desmos writes scientific notation the same way that we've seen.  An important note: There are other symbols that you might see sometimes on your calculator that look similar to this capital E, but they actually mean very different things.    : The lowercase e is a number that is important for lots of applications of mathematics. The name of this number is the same as the name of the letter: e. It is equal to about 2.71828, and should not be confused with the scientific notation symbol.   :This symbol, which looks like a sideways W, is called ‘sigma’. Sigma is a Greek letter, and it is sometimes used in mathematics to talk about addition.    "

  "title": "Data Visualization",
  "body": " Data Visualization   Any organized collection of information used to understand or solve a problem is called data . When you think of data, you may think of a long list of numbers which represent a measurement. However, this isn't generally the most useful way to look at a set of data. When we look at data, we use data visualizations to help us understand the data more quickly and efficiently. You're probably familiar with at least one type of data visualization, the graph, but we'll explore some more of the variety of ways in which people look at data in this module.    Types of Data  To understand data visualization, we first need to understand a bit about the way mathematicians talk about different kinds of data. Mathematicians broadly divide data into two types:   Qualitative (Categorical) Data  Data which is not numerical is called qualitative (or categorical) data. Qualitative data can include things like names, categories of objects or people (which is where the other name, categorical, comes from), or different things which are being compared.    Quantitative Data  Data which can be represented numerically is called quantitative data. This includes both data which is already numerical, and data which can be made numerical. Dates are a good example of quantitative data that isn't always written in numbers (for example, \"March\" doesn't seem numerical, but can be represented by 3 since it is the 3rd month of the year).  Quantitative data naturally falls into one of two types - discrete and continuous . While there are more complicated ways to distinguish between them mathematically, for our purpose the big difference is that with quantitative discrete data we have a small number of distinct possible responses, while with quantitative continuous data we have a large number of different possible responses.   It is important to be able to distinguish between quantitative discrete and quantitative continous data, because we visualize them in different ways. Quantitative discrete data is characterized by:  Small number of different values.  Many values are repeated.  Often (but not always) quantitative discrete data is counts of objects.  Quantitative continuous data is characterized by:  Many different values.  Most data values are distinct or only occur a few times.  Often (but not always) quantitative continuous data are measurements.      Two boxes filled with numbers. The box on the left displays an example containing quantitative discrete data with many repeated values: 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1, 4, 5, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, and 4. The box on the right contains quantitative continuous data with many different distinct values: 31, 53, 63, 18, 42, 31, 57, 86, 78, 29, 49, 22, 48, 85, 23, 19, 94, 11, 41, 31, 19, 17, 82, and 83.   Quantitative discrete (left) vs. Quantitative continuous (right) data.   Let's look at some data and decide whether it's qualitative, qunatitative discrete, or quantitative continuous.   A survey asks people how many cars they own.  Would the answers here be numeric or non-numeric? Are multiple people likely to give the same answer? Would you expect to have many different answers?  Quantitative Discrete. The answer is a number, and most people will answer 0, 1, or 2, with with very few people giving larger numbers.    A researcher collects a list of the companies which emit the most methane into the atmosphere.  Would this data be numeric or non-numeric?  This is qualitative data - the data we are collecting consists of company names, not numbers.    A scientist measures the amount of ozone in parts per million in the atmosphere at a particular location every day for a year. Note: here the scientist is collecting two different (connected) pieces of data - the measurement of ozone and the day on which they collected it.  Would this data be numeric or non-numeric? Are many of the measurements likely to be exactly the same on multiple days? Would you expect to have a lot of different values?  Both data sets are quantitative continuous. The dates will be different on every day, and there will be many (365 or 366) different values. The measurements are also unlikely to be exactly the same on different days, and there will be many different values.     Graphs   Small amounts of data can be represented through things like lists and tables, but more complicated data is easier to understand through a visual representation. Visual representations of data allow us to see patterns and trends in the data that would be much harder to detect in a simple list or table.  The most common types of visual representation of data are called graphs or charts . While you're probably familiar with many types of graphs, we'll be introducing some that you may not be familiar with, and focusing on how and when to use the different types. There are many different types of graphs, because each one is used to display different types of information and highlight different aspects of that information. In the following subsubsections, we'll go through each of the types of graphs    Bar Graphs  A bar graph is a graph which represents data as bars of various heights. A bar graph can be used in several different ways.  The first way that a bar graph can be used is to display a single set of qualitative or quantitative discrete data. This is done by taking a data set and translating it into a frequency table .   Frequency Table A frequency table lists each of the distinct values in a data set followed by the frequency of that value - the number of times that it appears in the data set.  An example of a frequency table, which displays a quantitative discrete data set is given below. The American Community Survey, part of the US Census, asks Americans how many vehicles their household has access to (either owned or shared). The number of vehicles is quantitative discrete because most households in the USA have access to 0, 1, 2, or 3 cars. The data from 2019 is shown in the table :     Number of Vehicles Available  Millions of Households    0  10.6    1  39.8    2  45.3    3  18.1    4  6.3    5+  2.7     This data can be turned into a bar graph which uses the frequency (the number of households in millions that gave a particular response) as the height of the bars.    Bar graph showing vehicle access per household. Image description available.  Vehicle Access per household from the 2019 American Community Survey. Image Description .    If your data set is quantitative continuous, you can still create a frequency table, but you need to sort the data into ranges. If you don't, most of your data values will have very low frequencies, and you'll have a ton of different values to graph. A bar graph which displays quantitative continuous data with that data sorted into ranges is called a histogram .  The data below represents the per capita emissions, in tons of CO2 per person, of 97 nations across the world. You can see from the data that if we look at the frequency of each value, almost all of them have frequency 1 (a handful, like 0.09 and 0.13, have frequency 2). Creating a bar graph of these values wouldn't be very useful, but if we sort them into categories - 0 to 5, 5 to 10, etc. - we can see more patterns in the data.  0.02, 0.04, 0.07, 0.09, 0.09, 0.13, 0.13, 0.23, 0.25, 0.26, 0.29, 0.32, 0.36, 0.38, 0.52, 0.55, 0.56, 0.6, 0.67, 0.85, 0.86, 0.99, 1.01, 1.05, 1.09, 1.1, 1.11, 1.13, 1.23, 1.46, 1.52, 1.59, 1.68, 1.69, 1.74, 1.76, 1.92, 1.94, 1.95, 2, 2.19, 2.3, 2.37, 2.38, 2.45, 2.48, 2.5, 2.52, 2.56, 2.66, 2.72, 2.75, 3.38, 3.48, 3.58, 3.66, 3.79, 4.02, 4.08, 4.17, 4.21, 4.53, 4.64, 4.66, 4.83, 5.18, 5.67, 5.67, 5.76, 5.81, 5.94, 6.2, 7.08, 7.2, 7.46, 7.64, 7.67, 7.87, 8.31, 8.41, 8.76, 9, 9.07, 9.85, 12.76, 12.96, 14.49, 14.82, 15.25, 16.44, 17.69, 18.82, 19.31, 21.12, 23.47, 31.45, 36.46  Notice that in making our categories, we're careful to not let them overlap - we don't want to accidentally count a value, like 10, that is on the edge in two categories. We also want to make sure that we don't have too many different categories. While you can make a histogram with as many categories as you like, it's generally best to keep the number of categories small, so that there are a lot of data elements in most of them. If you use too many categories, then you will be back in the situation where almost every column contains just one or two elements.     Per Capita Emissions  Number of Countries    [0,5)  65    [5,10)  19    [10,15)  4    [15,20)  5    [20,25)  2    [25,30)  0    [30,35)  1    [35,40)  1       Histogram showing the number of countries with per capita emissions at a particular level. Image description available.   Countries in the world, sorted by their per capita CO2 emissions in tons of CO2 per person. Data from . Image Description .   A bar graph can also be used to display a correspondence between two different types of data, as long as one of them is quantitative. The quantitative data will be used for the height of the bar. For example, the table below shows the amount of methane produced by the ten countries which produce the most greenhouse gases, in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide. The country names are qualitative data, and each country has a corresponding quantitative continuous value which represents the amount of methane they produce. This data is taken from .

Graph showing bars with sizes corresponding to the methane emissions of 10 countries, dominated by China, the United States, and India. Image description available.   Methane Emissions of the ten largest polluters, in the equivalent amount of CO2. Data from . Image Description    To summarize, bar graphs are generally used to display a single set of data or to show a correspondence between two data sets. They are one of the most versatile and flexible forms of data visualization, and can be used in a variety of contexts. Unless there is a good reason to choose another type of graph, a bar graph is usually the best way to take a first look at a set of data.    Pie Charts  A pie chart is a specialized type of graph which is used to display a single set of data. It is usually used when there are a small number of different data values (less than 10), but can be used effectively with more. In a pie chart, a circle is divided into wedges, with each wedge corresponding to a different data value or group of data values. The size of the wedge is determined by the percentage of the data which matches that data value or group of values.  To create a pie chart, you should first create a frequency table. However, unlike a bar graph, to create a pie chart you need to know the relative frequency .   Relative Frequency The relative frequency of a data value is the percentage of overall values which match that data value. It can be calculated by taking the frequency and dividing it by the total number of data values.  Let's add relative frequency to . First, we calculate the total number of data values, by adding up all the frequencies. There are 122.8 million households total in this data set. To find the relative frequency, we just take each frequency and divide by 122.8. For example, because 10.57 million households do not have access to a car at all, the relative frequency of the data value 0 is   We repeat this for each value to fill in the rest of the frequency table.     Number of Vehicles Available  Millions of Households  Percentage of Households    0  10.57  9%    1  39.82  32%    2  45.29  37%    3  18.09  15%    4  6.30  5%    5+  2.74  2%    Total  122.80       Once we have a frequency table with relative frequency, we can create a pie chart. To create a pie chart, divide the circle into wedges, where each wedge takes up some percentage of the total circle. Those percentages should match the relative frequencies in your frequency table. Making a pie chart by hand can be tricky, because you need to estimate what different percentages of the circle would be.    A circle divided into wedges, one for each data value in the table above, with the size of the wedge determined by the relative frequency.   Number of vehicles accessible to each household in the United States, as a percentage of the total number of households. Data from .   For quantitative continuous data, your wedges of the pie chart will correspond to ranges of values instead of individual values. For example, here is the data from , with relative frequencies:     Per Capita Emissions  Number of Countries  Relative Frequency    [0,5)  65  67%    [5,10)  19  20%    [10,15)  4  4%    [15,20)  5  5%    [20,25)  2  2%    [25,30)  0  0%    [30,35)  1  1%    [35,40)  1  1%    Total  97       When we create a pie chart from this data, we get the following image    A circle divided into wedges, one for each range of values in the table. Image description available.   Number of countries with per capita CO2 emissions in the given ranges. Image description .   Note that in the image, several wedges represent very small percentages of the total number of countries. This provides very little information and makes the graph more cluttered. Let's re-do our frequency table, combining all of the categories above 20 tons per person into one group:     Per Capita Emissions  Number of Countries  Relative Frequency    [0,5)  65  67%    [5,10)  19  20%    [10,15)  4  4%    [15,20)  5  5%    > 20  4  4%    Total  97       The pie chart now has only 5 categories, and is much less cluttered. The information - that most countries have CO2 emissions less than 5 tons per person, and that only a few countries have very high per capita emissions, is now presented much more clearly.    A circle divided into wedges, one for each data value in the table above, with the size of the wedge determined by the relative frequency.   Number of countries with per capita CO2 emissions in the given ranges.     Scatterplots and Line Graphs  Our next type of graph is used when we have a correspondence between two quantitative continuous data sets. In a scatterplot , we plot a point on the x-y coordinates which represents a pair of data values. Those points, then, can reveal patterns in how the data sets are related.  Our data set for this example will consist of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of how wealthy a country is, and CO2 emissions. Both of these numbers will naturally be larger for larger countries, because more people will produce more wealth and more CO2, so we consider the per capita numbers, meaning the amount of money or CO2 per person. We can get these numbers by taking the total amount and dividing by the population of the country. If you already know that there is a relationship between data sets because of something like population, dividing out by the value is an easy way to eliminate that relationship. This is called normalizing the data set.  Because our data set has these values for 165 countries, we will not include the data table in the text. The data can be found in gdp and co2 emissions for all countries in 2018 [Excel Spreadsheet] (data from ). We can construct a scatterplot by taking each pair of values and creating a point. For example, the nation of Qatar has per capita CO2 emissions of 39.27 tons per person, and a GDP of $153,764 per person. This is because Qatar is a very small nation (Qatar only had 2.7 million people in 2018, when this data was collected) which produces a large amount of oil - oil production is a major source of CO2 emissions and countries with large oil production tend to use more fossil fuels. Qatar would be marked by a dot at x = 39.27, and y = 153,764. Yemen, a country close to Qatar, but much poorer and with much less oil production (and which was fighting a civil war in 2018) has per capita CO2 emissions of only 0.35 tons per person, and a per capita GDP of only $2,285 per person. The dot for Yemen would be at x=0.35 and y=2,285.  Here is a scatterplot of the entire data set:    Scatterplot of the gdp and co2 data. Image description available.   Scatterplot of the relationship between GDP and CO2, per capita, of nations in 2018. Image Description .   Scatterplots are useful because they help us see patterns in the data. In this graph, we can see that for countries with low emissions and low GDP, an increase in GDP generally corresponds to an increase in CO2 emissions. This makes sense, because we associate increased economic activity with increased usage of fossil fuels. We see this especially in the dot for Qatar, located at the extreme right & top of the graph. However, a number of wealthier nations, including Norway (84,580, 8.21), Singapore (68,402, 6.65), Ireland (64,684, 8.85), Switzerland (61,373, 4.33), and Sweden (45,542, 4.19) don't fit this trend, having much lower emissions than nations with similar GDPs. Similarly, there are a number of nations with much higher emissions than countries with similar GDPs - Trinidad & Tobago (28,549, 27.24), Mongolia (13,383, 20.35), Kazakhstan (25,308, 17.45), and Bahrain (39,499, 20.14). While you can see this from looking at the data table, it is much easier to see these data points that stand out (called outliers ) from looking at the scatterplot.  Each of these countries has a unique reason why their CO2 emissions are lower or higher than expected from GDP. Do some research on your own and see if you can explain why they don't fit the general trend of the other points.  When we have two quantitative continuous data sets where there are no repeated values in one data set, a type of scatterplot called a line graph can be used. In a line graph, the data set with no repeated values is marked on the horizontal axis. Adjacent points are then connected by short lines.  Line graphs are used to imply that, although we do not have data values for every x-axis value, we can assume that the data between values follows a similar pattern. The lines are a visual way of indicating this. Line graphs are frequently used when one data set represents time (since there will only be one data value for each time).  The data in global mean temperature anomalies [Excel Spreadsheet] is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This data gives the global mean temperature anomaly for every year from 1880 to 2019. Because we have a correspondence between quantitative continuous data values (year and global mean temperature anomaly), and because there is only one value for each year, this data is an ideal candidate for a line graph.    Line graph of the global mean temperature anomaly. Image description available.   Line graph of the global mean temperature anomaly fom 1880 to 2019. Data is from . Image Description .     Combining Graphs  You can show multiple data sets at the same time by combining these graphs in various ways. If the two data sets have quantitative values in the same (or similar) ranges, it may make sense to combine them into a single bar chart (with different colored\/shaded bars for each data set) or a single line graph (with a different color\/pattern for each data set).  For example, the data in total co2 emissions of the USA and China [Excel Spreadsheet] is from the World Bank. The data gives the CO2 emissions of the United States and China from 1960 to 2018 in kilotons. Because these data sets have a similar scale, we can display them on a single graph. We use a line graph because the data set is quantitative continuous and has a single value for each year.    Line graphs of the total CO2 emissions of the United States and China. Image description available.   Paired line graph of the total CO2 emissions of the United States and China from 1960 to 2018 in gigatons. Data is from . Image Description .   If you have data with very different scales, though, a paired line graph is not a great choice. Consider the graph below, which shows CO2 emissions for the United States again (in gigatons) and the emissions for Singapore, a much smaller nation with much lower emissions.    Line graphs of the total CO2 emissions of the United States and Singapore. Image description available.   Paired line graph of the total CO2 emissions of the United States and Singapore from 1960 to 2018 in gigatons. Data is from . Image Description .   Because Singapore's emissions are so much less than those of the United States, the graph shows them to be essentially 0 - which is not the case. We don't see anything of the pattern of how Singaporean emissions have changed over the past 60 years because the US emissions are so much larger. To show these two data sets together, it is better to graph them each individually.     Line graphs of the total CO2 emissions of Singapore. Image description available.   Total CO2 emissions of Singapore from 1960 to 2018 in kilotons. Data is from . Image Description .     Line graphs of the total CO2 emissions of the United States. Image description available.   Total CO2 emissions of the United States from 1960 to 2018 in kilotons. Data is from . Image Description .    Bar charts can be combined in a similar way - putting bars for two different things on the same graph if they have similar scales, or putting two bar charts side by side if they have different scales. Here's a bar chart that shows the percentage of households that own 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5+ vehicles in Great Britain and in the United States.    Bar chart of vehicle ownership in Great Britain and the United States. Image description available.   Percentage of households owning 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more vehicles in Great Britain (data from 2014-2016) and the United States (data from 2019). Data is from and . Image Description .   Looking at a paired bar graph like this can help you compare the amounts for different data sets. For example, this graph shows us that Americans tend to own more cars per households than the British, and are more likely to have a car in their household.  If we want to compare two data sets using pie charts, you can take the same approach and look at two pie charts side-by-side.     Pie chart of household vehicle access in the USA. Image description available.   Number of vehicles accessible to each household in the United States, as a percentage of the total number of households. Data from . Image Description .     Pie chart of household vehicle access in Great Britain. Image description available.   Number of vehicles accessible to each household in Great Britain, as a percentage of the total number of households. Data from . Image Description .    A more effective way to display the data from two pie charts is to combine them into a stacked bar chart. A stacked bar chart is used to compare the relative frequencies of data in two different data sets. The data can be any kind of data, but if it is quantitative continuous it will need to be divided into categories. In a stacked bar chart, each bar acts like a pie chart - with the different sections of the bars representing the percentages of the entire group. Each bar goes all the way from the bottom (0%) to the top (100%), split up into pieces which represent the percentages.    Stacked bar chart comparing vehicle ownership in the United States and Great Britain. Image Description available.   Number of vehicles accessible to each household in the United States compared to Great Britain, as a percentage of the total number of households. Data from and . Image Description .   Notice here that our bar chart is horizontal instead of vertical. This is entirely an aesthetic choice - we can do horizontal or vertical bars for any chart. You should do whichever looks better or fits better in your document. Here, we used horizontal bars so that we could fit the percent values on each section of the bar.    Other Ways of Visualizing Information  The internet has greatly changed the way that people visualize data. With books, magazines, and newspapers, data visualizations were restricted to static images like graphs and charts. The modern internet provides the ability to use more dynamic and interactive data visualizations. These data visualizations can be useful and help people understand data better, but they can also be overwhelming. We'll look at some examples and talk about the advantages and disadvantages of these types of data visualizations.  One example of a data visualization using the internet is a video which shows multiple different graphs. Sometimes these visualizations will just be a series of graphs like the ones we've seen before. For example, the graph in showed the relationship between the gross domestic product (GDP) and CO2 emissions per person for countries in 2018. The video in shows the same data, but for every year from 1961 to 2014. It also adds another data set - how much the temperature in that country has gone up or down from the average over 1961-2018. The temperature change is represented by the color and size of the dot.    National gross domestic product and CO2 emissions per person 1961-2014. Video by Antti Lipponen, CC-BY-2.0 . .   This graph contains a lot of information - 3 different data sets (GDP, CO2 Emissions, and temperature change) for every country for every year from 1961-2014. Looking at all of that data in a table could be overwhelming, but this visualization makes it easier to see certain patterns. We can see that in general, as time changes, the nations of the world are getting richer (the points move right), producing more CO2 (the points move up), and hotter (the points get larger and more red). We can also see that despite all these changes, inequality persists - some countries remain poor while others get even more wealthy.  In some ways, though, the visualization also hides other information. This graph uses a logarithmic scale on both axes. In a normal scale on a graph (what we call a linear scale in mathematics), when you go a unit over on the graph, you add the same amount on the scale - so you may go from 10 at one mark, to 20 at the next, to 30 at the next, adding 10 each time. In a logarithmic scale, instead of adding each time, you multiply by the same amount. For example, on this graph, the marks on the horizontal axis go from 100 to 1000, multiplying by 10, and then to 10,000, multiplying by 10 again, and then 100,000, multiplying by 10 again.  Logarithmic scales are used when we have very small numbers and very large numbers in the same graph, like we do here - some countries have much lower GDPs than others, because of global wealth inequality. The logarithmic scale conceals an increase in inequality in this graph - as the points move to the left and up, the gap between the poorest & least emitting countries and the wealthiest & most emitting countries is getting larger and larger.  Other video data visualizations use different graphing techniques. The video in , the position of the points doesn't really convey any information (it's just determined by the country's name in the English alphabet), but the size and color of the dot gives the temperature anomaly for that country in a particular month. You can see the points get larger and redder as the climate warms.    Monthly temperature anomaly for countries from 1880-2017. Video by Antti Lipponen, CC-BY-2.0 . .   The visualization in gives the viewer a very clear picture of how severe and widespread the warming has been in countries around the world. It does not, however, give a lot of data on how that warming is spread out, because the countries are arranged alphabetically. The video in shows the CO2 emissions per country for each year from 1850 to 2016, but arranged on a map of the world (unfortunately, a Mercator projection, which creates a biased map where northern countries appear much larger than those near the equator). This allows the viewer to see a different kind of pattern - the geographical relationship between countries with high CO2 emissions.    Map of the world, showing greenhouse gas emissions per person for each country. .    shows us that greenhouse gas emissions per person have grown most in large fossil fuel producing nations like the USA, Canada, and Russia, as well as smaller nations in West Asia like Oman and Saudia Arabia. It does conceeal some of the highest emitters, like Bahrain and Qatar, which can be seen in , because they are too small to show up clearly on the map.  Data visualizations on the internet can also be interactive. The Earth Sciences Communications Team at the National Aeronautics and Space Association's (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory has produced several outstanding interactive data visualizations around climate change. The Climate Time Machine allows viewers to see how the climate has changed over time in four different ways - sea ice, sea level, CO2 emissions, and temperature change. Earth Now is even more elaborate, allowing the viewer to display a wide range of global data sets on an animated globe, and to look at that data over a range of time or at a point in history.    Accessibiliity  All of these data visualizations - both the static images we saw before and the videos here - have one major flaw. These visualizations, because they convey data visually, are only accessible to people without visual impairment. People with no sight or sight which is limited in some way (like color-blindness) may be unable to use data visualizations as effectively as people without visual impairment.  Visualizations can also present challenges to other people. A fast-moving video, for example, may be difficult to follow for someone with dyslexia who needs more time to read. Someone who is hearing-impaired may need captions if there is spoken text or sounds. Translators exist for text in webpages, but the text in an image or video cannot be translated easily into another language.  When creating data visualizations, it is important to think about who will be able to use it. The more accessible you make your visualization, the more people will be able to benefit from it. Here are some tips for how to make your data visualizations accessible:   Avoid using color alone to differentiate data - and use highly contrasting colors if you do need to use color. People with color-blindness or limited vision may be able to distinguish highly contrasting colors better.  Make data available in another format. A data table - which can be read out by a screen reader - may be more useful than a graph for someone who is visually impaired.  Don't try to let the graph speak for itself - label everything clearly and in a large font. Explain what the graph shows in the accompanying text.  Choose a good title for your graph. People with reading or attention disabilities may read only the title, so make sure it conveys as much information about what the graph means as possible.  Use redundancy - for example, a particular quality may be represented by both the color and size of a dot. If someone doesn't notice or can't detect one quality, they may be able to detect the other.   One example of accessibility is the creation of data sonifications - like a visualization, but with sound. The online graphing calculator Desmos, for example, has a feature called Audio Trace which allows users to hear a graph in the graphing calculator. The sound moves across stereo speakers from left to right, and increases in pitch as the graph increases (with static added when it's negative). This allows visually-impaired people the opportunity to hear the same patterns that others can see in the graph.  A powerful climate change sonification from the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics at Stanford University is \"shown\" in . In this sonification, which starts roughly 400 years ago, the CO2 levels in the atmosphere provide the pitch for a background tone, while a strumming guitar sound gets louder and higher in pitch as temperature anomalies increase. The result is a haunting sound which becomes more and more urgent as time approaches the present - just like the climate crisis.    Climate data from the past 400 years as a single sound file. The pitch of the background tone rises as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, while the plucked sound of the guitar increases in volume and pitch as global temperatures increase.      "

  "title": "Mathematical Models",
  "body": " Mathematical Models   Mathematical models provide a means of capturing how a confluence of variables factor into and effect situations They can also be used to make predictions regarding what is to come. In this section we examine models that lend insight into global warming and the average global temperature predictions. We will look at the Green House Effect and explore how to predict temperature increase based on varying amounts (distributions) of certain greenhouse gasses. The main green house gasses are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Each has its own impact on temperature increase dependent on a combination of qualities including lifetime, abundance, and radiative capacity. Units and other measures are often defined to capture how a confluence of qualities effect a particular inpact. Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP) are two such examples that will also examine in this section.     The Green House Effect  The overarching idea of the Green House effect is that energy in the form of radiation enters the atmosphere (\"the green house\") and while some of the radiation escapes, a percentage of it gets trapped. This trapped radiation is trapped energy or heat which results in increasing the ambient temperature. The percentage of energy that gets trapped and the resulting temperature increase depends on the molecular make up of the atmosphere.  Green House gasses are gasses that trap energy. Some of the gasses such as water vapor ( ) are necessary for maintaining a stable temperature warm enough to supports life. However, growing amounts of other Green House gasses such as carbon dioxide ( ), nitrious oxide ( ), and methane have the effect of increasing the temperature potentially beyond livable conditions. How much energy gets trapped the depends on the molecular make up of the atmosphere.  In this section we will work through a simplified mathematical model with the goal of building intuition for how each compnent plays a role in the system.    Blackbody  When electromagnetic radiation is incident upon an object, some of the radition is absorbed while some is reflected. The specific proportions that are absorbed and radiated depend on the properties of the object and whether it is in thermodynamic equlibrium with the surrounding evironment. A blackbody is an perfect object in the sense that it abosorbs all the radiation incident upon it and emits radiation depending solely on its temperature.    There are two important properties of blackbodies that we will rely on in our modeling. One is that blackbodies are \"perfect\" emitters.  Not only is the amount of radiation emitted dependent only on temperature but also, for a fixed temperature, blackbodies emit at the maximal energy level. More specifics of this radiation are described below.  Blackbodies emit radiation isotropically, meaning the radiation is equally dispersed in all directions.      Blackbody Radiation   A blackbody in thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e with constant uniform temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation at a spectrum of wavelengths determined solely by the temperature of the body. The emission brom blackbodies is called blackbody radiation .  Blackbodies emit different amounts of energy at different wavelengths. How much radiation a blackbody emits at each wavelength is called the blackbody spectrum and is determined by Plank's law.   Below is a graph showing the blackbody spectrum. Each curve is the spectrum for blackbody at the indicated temperature. The temperatures are in Kelvin. Note that is and so for high temperatures like or the magnitude in degress Kelvin and degrees Celcius are on the order of magnitude. For reference the sun has a temperature of 5778 Kelvin      This is a graph of the blackbody spectrum depicting the amount of radiation emmitted at each wavelength for blackbodies at temperatues of 3,000 Kelvin, 4,000 Kelvin, and 5000 Kelvin. Each curve has a single peak and is skewed left. At the temerature increases, the peak of the curve shifts left, occuring at shorter wavelenghts. The wavelengths in the UV spectrum (0.01 to 0.38 ) are indicated by a vertical rectangle. The blackbody at 3000 Kelvin peaks in intensity at about 0.97 (in the near infrared). The blackbody at 4000 Kelvin peaks in intesity at about 0.725 (visible but slightly too long for red). The blackbody at 5000 Kelvin peaks in intensity at 0.58 (visible green light)   This graph depicts the blackbody spectrum showing the intensity of emission versus wavlength for blackbodies at temperatures of 3000, 4000, and 5000 Kelvin.    Very few objects are perfect blackbodies. However many are close enough in the sense that assuming blackbody radiation in calculations yeilds results that lend an accurate perspective. Of course the closer an object is to being a blackbody, the more acurate the calculations will be. For our models we will need the relationship between the amount of radiation emitted by a blackbody and its temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law gives this relationship and states that the total energy, emitted per unit area per unit time by a blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. The units are terms joules per second per square meter and are denoted . So or where with units of is the Stefan-Boltzman constant.   The radiative bodies that will play a role in our models are the Sun, Earth, and layers of the atmosphere. In our calculations we will assume that the Sun and Earth radiate as perfect blackbodies. The layers of the atmosphere are not close enough to perfect blackbodies so we will take them to be what is called graybodies .   Graybody  The term graybody refers to an imperfect blackbody in the sense that it absorbs only a propotion of the incident radiation. Graybodies can be more reflective of reality and adjusting for the lower absorption rate is a matter of scaling by what is called the emissivity.     Emissivity  The emissivity,  of a radiating object is the ratio of the amount of radiation the object emits compared to amount of radiation a blackbody at the same temperature, emits.    The emissivity is a proportion and thus dimensionless.   The emissivity ranges between which two values?  Think about the extremem cases. What is the most incident radiation an object can abosorb and what is the least as compared to that of a blackbody?  The emissivity ranges bewtween 0 and 1 inclusive.    Interpret the meaning of a radiating body with the minimal and the maximal emissivity. Why does this make sense?  What does it mean for the emmissivty ratio to be equal to 0 in terms of how much radiation it absorbs? What does it mean for the ration to be eqaul to 1 in terms of how much radiation it absorbs. What does this tell you about the type of object?  When the emissivity of a radiating body is 0, a radiating body aborbs none of the incent radiation and is thus a perfect reflector. When the emissivity is 1, a radiating body absorbs as much incedent radiation as a blackbody. Namely it aborbs all the incident radiation and is thus a perfect blackbody.   A graybody that absorbs only a proportion of incident radiation also emits a proportion of the blackbody radiation. For our models we assume the proportion absorbed is the same as the proportion emitted. This absorption\/emission propotion is exactly the emissivity of the object. So, for a graybody at temperature, , with emissivity the total energy, , emitted per unit area per unit time is .   What is the amount of radiation, , emitted by radiating bodies with minimal and maximal emissivity. Why does this make sense?  When the emissivity of a radiating body is 0, the body emits . So a body that absorbs no incident radiation also emits no radiation. When the emissivity is 1, the body emits which matches that of a     Modeling the Green House Effect   Our goal is not to create a perfect model that caputes every physical detail but rather invoke some simple mathematics so that we can view the conceptual model through an analytical lense. In the process we will introduce and engage with the mathematical thought that goes into modeling. We will work our way up step by step each time making a single generalization reflecting a bit more physical reality.  There are three major players in our series of models: our Sun, the Earth, and the Atmosphere.  The Sun radiates energy in all directions. Some of the Sun's energy is reflected by the atomosphere and the rest reaches the Earth. In our models, we will assume that the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth is fixed. We will deonte this value by . However, in reality, the amount of solar energy reaching Earth is starting to increase. This increase is caused by a decrease in albedo . Albedo, denoted , is the proportion of solar energy that is reflected by the atmosphere. Melting ice caps, catalyzed by global warming, are responsible for the decrease in albedo. While we will not take the changing albedo into account, doing so could make a great extension project.  We will denote the amount of energy the Earth radiates by . For the purpose of our models we will take the Earth to be a blackbody. By the Stefan-Boltzmann law, or where is the temperature of Earth's surface.  We will be treating the atmosphere as a graybody. Initially we will take the atmosphere to be a single body. We wil denote the amount of energy that radiates out from the atmosphere as . As a graybody, and where is the temperature of the atmosphere and is the emissivity of the atmosphere. Recall that as graybody, the atmosphere also aborbs only a proportion, , of radiation incidident upon it.  One key assumption is that all compents are equilibrium.    First Model: one level of atmosphere  In this model we have our Sun, the Earth's surface, and the atmosphere. Solar energy reaches Earth's surface. The Earth radiates out engery as a blackbody. The atmosphere absorbs a proportion, , of energy radiated by the earth and also radiates out energy as a graybody.        The Sun, Earth's surface, and atmosphere all radiate out energy as well as absorb energy from the other bodies.    In the diagram above, each arrow starts at a radiating body and arrives to an absorbing body.  Let's recall our variables.   is the amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface.   is the energy radiated per unit area by Earth surface.   is the energy radiated per unit area by the atmosphere.    Both the Earth's surface and the atomosphere radiate isotropically (i.e equally in all directions). We capture this in our model by assuming half of the energy radiated by the atmosphere escapes out while half radiates back towards the earth. Since the Earth is a lower physical boundary in our model, we assume all the earth's radiation moves outwards and reaches the atmosphere. Let's include radiation labels in out diagram.            Recall that our system involving the Sun, Earth, and atmosphere is in a state of equilibrium. This means the amount of radiation absorbed by each body is equal to the amount radiation that body emits. We can write out a set of equilibrium equations.  Now let's use the Stefan-Boltzman law to write the radiation and in terms of temperature. With and the equations become What we really want to understand is how the emissivity of the atmosphere , affects the temperatures of the Earth and the atmosphere since emissivity is the link between greenhouse gasses and temperature increas. The higher the emissivity, , the more radiation our atmospher absorbs or traps. The absorption of radiation is due to molecules in the atmosphere and higher concentrations of greenhouse gasses push up .  First use the \"atmosphere\" equation to relate the termperatures of the Earth and atmosphere. Simplifying the last \"atmosphere\" equation we see that the temperature of the Earth is related to that of the atmosphere by or Now we use the \"earth\" equation to write and in terms of the know quatities,Q and , and the emissivity .  Substituting into the \"earth\" equation we have .  Solving for yields and Let's plug in the values for the constants.         Note: ( with the solar constant and albedo )  So our equations become    What happens to and as increases?  Emissivity ranges from 0 to 1. So when increases and both increase since the denominator decreases.    Based on the possible values for what are the possible temperature ranges for and ?  Emissivity ranges from 0 to 1. ranges from 127.45 to 254.9 K. When , is at its minimum of 127.45 K and when , is at its maximum of 254.9 K. ranges from 151.65 to 303.3 K.    What happens to the rate of atmospheric absorption as increases ?  It's increasing.   Currently the sufrace temerpature of the Earth is about . In Kelvin this is . If we plug this temperature into our equation above we can use our model to predict the current atmospheric emissivity.    Take the current temperature of the earth to be . What does out model predic is?  Solving for we find . So for ,     For the current Earth temperature of 288.3 K or , our model estimates as 0.947. The actual value of , accoding to , is predicted to be . In the next section you will have a chance to incorporate more details and develop a more presice model. In the meantime, while our model is somewhat off, we can still look at how a change in emissivity due to an increase in green house gasses effects the Earth's temperature.  According to if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles , it will cause the atmospheric emissivity to increase by 0.019.  Let's use our model to see the what is effect of an increase of 0.019 in emissivity (and thus in doubling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) on the Eath's temperature. We have two options for using our model to predict the change in temperature.  We can use the actual value of and our predicted value of 0.947 for   We can use the actual value of 0.78 for and the current temperature predicted by our model for      Use the actual value of 288.3 K for and the our model's predition of 0.947 for . If the amount of carbon in the atmosphere were to double today so that would increase by 0.019, use our model to determine the increase in the Earth's temperature. In the atmosphere's temperature.   would increase from 0.947 to 0.966 and our model predeicts that the Earth's temperature will increase from 288.3 K to 293.3 K or from to     Use the actual value of 0.78 for and the current temperature predicted by our model for . If the amount of carbon in the atmosphere were to double today, would increase from 0.019 from 0.78 to 0.80. According to our model, what is the increase in the Earth's temperature? In the atmosphere's temperature?  According to our model would increase from 248.6 K to 252.6 K or from to so would increase . would increase from   In the exercises above you determined that if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were to double, the Earth's temperature would increase or depending on if we used the actual value for earth's temperature or atmosphe's emissivity and used our model to predict the emissivity or temperature respectively.  Let's compare our results to those stated in the literature. According to , the Earth's temperature is currently 288.3 K or and the atmospheric emissivity is . If the amount of carbon dixoide in the atmosphere were to double is predicted to increase from 0.78 to 0.80 which in turn would cause the Earth's temperature to increase from 288.3 K ( ) to 289.5 K ( ).  Our model is not that far off and while our model is not precise it allows us to see and feel the effect of doubling the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, when it comes to climate change and predicting temperature increase we do want to experts to have a smaller margin of error.  Now that we have developed some analytical intuition for the greenhouse effect, we are ready for the next step. We will build on our current model, taking into accout other physical factors that will hopefully result is more presision.      "

  "title": "Solving for Change",
  "body": " Solving for Change   How can the mathematics we've learned help us to understand the issue of greenhouse gas emissions better? And how can it help us find solutions and areas to focus our energy?  We're going to use our mathematics knowledge to try to answer three questions: Who is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, what are the strategies for reducing emissions, and what are the most effective ways for us to combat climate change?    Who is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions?  The question of responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions has emerged as a major one in recent years. The Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 treaty, and the Paris Climate Accords, in 2016, sought to set targets for individual nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These treaties approached climate change from the perspective of shared responsibility, in a historical sense. Figure shows how this responsibility for global emissions has changed over time in a stacked 100% line graph . A stacked 100% line graph is like a pie chart stretched out over time - each vertical \"slice\" of the graph represents the percentage that that region contributed to global greenhouse gas emissions in that year. You can see in the graph that at the beginning (1750), Europe contributed 100% of the recorded emissions of CO2. As time goes on, other regions, like the USA, began to contribute more, and in the 20th century emissions from other parts of the world, like China, India, and the remainder of North America, began to grow.   Stacked 100% line graph of historical share of total co2 emissions share from 1750 to present. Image description available.  Percentage of total global CO2 emissions since 1750. EU-27 contains emissions from the 27 nations of the European Union in 2021, with the United Kingdom and Russia (and other nations) in Europe (excl. EU-27). Image CC-BY 4.0 by Hannah Ritchie . Image Description .   In the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Climate Accords, one of the main points of discussion was how much each nation should be asked to cut their emissions. Major emitters today, like China and India, argued that the burden of stopping greenhouse gas emissions should fall mainly on developed nations like the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries, because the CO2 that those nations emitted in the past has been and still is a major contributor to climate change. Those nations now enjoy a high quality of life at least in part because of the emissions which they made in the past, but many have substantially reduced their emissions already. Emissions from Europe & the United States account for 58% of total cumulative emissions since 1750, but only 30% of current emissions in 2019 .  Developed nations, on the other hand, argued that emissions reductions must be made by developing nations like China and India, because those nations account for such a large part of current emissions. While Asia accounts for 29% of historical emissions since 1750, in 2019 they accounted for 55% of current emissions, as seen in Figure . Because they account for such a large part of current emissions, substantial reductions in their emissions would make a much larger difference in future CO2 levels.

EU-27 contains emissions from the 27 nations of the European Union in 2021, with the United Kingdom and Russia (and other nations) in Europe (excl. EU-27). Image CC-BY 4.0 by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser . Image Description .   The Paris Climate Accords provided a mechanism for countries to set individual commitments to reducing emissions. These commitments are reviewed every 5 years, with the overall goal of limiting temperature rise to another . The agreement also seeks to provide funding to developing nations to help them reduce their emissions . This agreement seeks to strike a balance between the responsibility of nations who have already contributed to current greenhouse gas levels, and those nations which are contributing now.  This table contains the emissions for each region in 2019 and the population of each region in 2019 . We use data from 2019 so that we can ignore the effects of the pandemic, which caused an (unfortunately, short-term) reduction in CO2 emissions that was unequal across different regions.     Region  2019 Emissions  Population    International Transport     -    Oceania          Asia (excluding China & India)          China          India          Africa          South America          North America (excluding USA)          United States          Europe (excluding EU-27)          EU-27          Total           What does this table tell us about each region's share of emissions? Use the data in the table to answer the questions below.   Which region on this list contributed the most CO2 to the atmosphere in 2019?  Remember, in scientific notation, you compare the exponents first and then the digits.  China, with tons of CO2 in 2019, had higher emissions than any other region, because the exponent is larger than any other.    Some countries,like China, argue that their emissions are naturally higher because they have more people. Compare the United States and China - if you look instead at tons of CO2 per person, which one has higher emissions?  To find emissions per person, divide the total emissions by the population. Be careful to divide correctly with scientific notation!  In China, we have In the USA, we have The USA produces more than twice as much per person as China.   What are the factors that should be used in deciding how much each country should reduce emissions? Should the population of the country play a role in making this decision? What about the overall wealth and how developed the country is? Should larger countries, like India and China, that are still developing be allowed to reduce emissions less than well-developed regions like the USA and Europe? The effects of global warming are also unevenly distributed, with low-lying, typhoon-prone countries in Oceania and drought-prone & desertifying countries in Africa being hardest hit. These regions have lower emissions (Oceania's total is skewed up by the presence of Australia and New Zealand, both highly developed countries with higher emissions). Should they be asked to make the same sacrifices as other nations in terms of cutting emissions, when they will also need to be dealing with the other consequences of global warming? All of these are questions that mathematics can help us understand, by allowing us to compare the quantities involved, and the consequences of changing those quantities.    What are the strategies for reducing emissions?  You may have heard of the carbon footprint , a particular individual's contribution to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The idea of a carbon footprint is that each individual is responsible for their part of the greenhouse gas emission problem, and that they should do their part to help fix it. The Cool Climate Calculator from the University of California at Berkeley is one such carbon footprint calculator. The Cool Climate Calculator estimates how much carbon you personally produce, from sources such as driving, electricity, and foods you eat. It then provides suggestions for how you can reduce you carbon footprint, by doing things like driving less, carpooling, buying more efficient appliances, or becoming a vegetarian.  The idea of using carbon footprints to reduce emissions is that if everyone were aware of how much carbon they used, and made small changes, then our overall carbon use would go down. For example, livestock - animals raised for meat and other food products like milk - are estimated to make up 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions . Therefore, if everyone in the world switched to a vegan diet, those emissions would be reduced - though not eliminated, since they would be replaced by the emissions necessary to feed everyone a vegan diet instead.  Of course, getting everyone in the world to switch to a vegan diet would be very challenging. Individual actions to reduce emissions, like changing diet, buying more fuel-efficient vehicles, and switching to LED light bulbs do have an effect on overall emissions, but that effect is small. Effective climate change mitigation requires that these changes be made on a much larger scale.  The global pandemic, which shuttered businesses and reduced driving and energy use across the world, reduced carbon emissions into the atmosphere by only 5.4% . Experts estimate that we would need to reduce emissions by about 10 times that in order to keep global warming to 2 degrees Centigrade above pre-industrial levels. . If you think about how your life changed during the pandemic, imagine having to make similarly dramatic changes every year for 10 years to get a sense of how much you would need to change your life to solve this problem - and not only would you need to do it, but you would need to get everyone else to agree to do it too.  While the carbon footprint encourages individuals to make change in their own lives, other solutions focus on making broader change across entire countries or across the world. For example, another way to reduce emissions from livestock production would be to increases taxes and fees on meat production, encouraging people to eat less. The most effective ways to reduce emissions from driving - estimated to make up 25% of US emissions include requiring cars to have higher gas mileage, increasing the cost of gasoline, and developing better public transit.  By looking at the problem from a mathematical perspective, we can start to get an appreciation for the scale of the problem and which solutions will be most effective at solving it. The United Nations Environmental Programme has an interactive infographic on a Six Sector Solution for Climate Change which talks about the way that the solutions must balance individual and government action.   Which sector does the UN identify as the one where emissions can be cut the most? What are some strategies that they suggest to accomplish this?  The UN document identifies Energy as the sector where the most change can be accomplished, and suggests repealing policies which benefit the fossil fuel industry, introducing policies to support renewable energy, and reducing individual energy consumption.     Consequences of Failing to Act  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has built mathematical models - like the ones we studied in , but much more complicated - to predict how much global temperatures will rise in the future. These models are referred to as Representative Concentration Pathways (RPC), because they represent how the concentration of CO will change throughout the future . These models range from RCP2.6, in which humans manage to limit global warming to an average of 1.5 degrees Celsius, to RCP4.5 with an increase of 2.4 degrees celsius, RCP6.0 with an increase of 3 degrees, and RCP8.5, in which humans continue to increase emissions as we have been for centuries, with global warming on average of 4.9 degrees Celsius by the year 2100 (and more beyond that).  These mathematical models are built the same way that the ones in are - using the physical properties of greenhouse gases. Because they also depend upon assumptions about complicated climatological process, like the role of melting sea ice in cooling the Earth or how the warming sea levels reduce the carbon capacity of plankton in the ocean, the predicted warming can vary greatly in a particular model. The RCP8.5 model, for example, predicts global warming of 4.9 degrees by 2100, but with a margin of error around 1.3 degrees . This means that the modelers are confident (in this case, 90% confident) that the actual sea level rise in this scenario would be between and degrees Celsius. This would produce a corresponding global sea rise of 0.53 to 1.78 meters (1.74 to 5.84 feet).  This sea level rise would not be evenly distributed, because colder water is more dense than warm water. For example, water around Antarctica and Greenland would actually cool, because of the melting ice contributed by a warmer climate. Water in warmer areas would expand more. , from , gives lower, median, and upper estimates of the amount of sea level rise that different cities will experience under three scenarios - when warming is limited to 2℃, 4℃, and 5℃ by 2100.

For example, this map shows the New York City area with 2.2m of sea level rise , the upper limit of the sea level rise estimated in . You can see that large parts of the area are underwater, including Newark and LaGuardia International Airports, Coney Island, and large parts of downtown Manhattan, including the World Trade Center. The densely populated city of Guangzhou, China, would suffer even more under the worst-case scenario of 1.99 m of sea level rise .   What would London look like with the median sea level rise from 5℃ of global warming?  The median sea level rise from 5℃ of global warming is 0.78m, so we can round to 0.8m.   Putting this into the map, we get the following map of London . Substantial parts of South London would be under water, and even more of the port areas east of the city.     The article gives sea level rise figures for 136 coastal cities in Table S2. Find the median sea level rise in Miami if global warming is 5℃ by 2100. How does this compare to the median sea level rise if global warming is limited to 2℃ by 2100?  The median sea level rise with 5℃ is 0.86 m. With 2℃ it is 0.22 m.   With 0.9 m of sea level rise, substantial parts of Miami Beach and areas around the river will be flooded, as seen in this map of Miami .  With 0.2 m of sea level rise, only small coastal areas will flood, as seen in this map of Miami .    Of course, all of these sea level rise calculations only account for the level of the sea under normal conditions. Other factors, like tides and winds, especially the storm surge from hurricanes, can produce temporarily much higher sea levels. Cities like Miami already experience flooding during high tides, which can reach as high as 1.2 m above current sea level . Global warming will increase the frequency and amplitude of these high tides, making the flooding even worse.  Mathematical models can be used to estimate the storm surge from future storms. Like the rise in sea level, this is very specific to particular areas - in this case, because of the geography that causes storm surge. The shape of the sea in a particular area can increase flooding in one area and decrease it in others. A mathematical model of New York harbor in New York City predicts that storm surges from hurricanes, which currently average 2 m, could be 2.75 m on average by 2100 in the RCP4.5 (2.4 ℃ of warming) scenario or over 3 m in the RCP8.6 (5 ℃ of warming) scenario.   Use the maps to see what New York City would look like if it suffered a hurricane with a 3 m storm surge, on top of the median sea level rise from 5 ℃ of global warming.  3 m plus median sea level rise of 1.09 m is 4.09 meters above the current sea level.  4.1 meters over current sea level would inundate huge portions of the New York City area, as seen in this map of New York City . All three major airports are underwater, and entire neighborhoods - Downtown, SoHo, Long Island City, Flushing, Jersey City, Hoboken - would be damaged.     "

How much have they contributed overall to CO2 emissions? Give your answer in scientific notation.  How could the information in this chart be used to help us create effective strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?      The file Emissions by Country\/Region from gives data for countries and regions around the world. The data includes:  Country Name  Population  Total CO2 Emissions in 2021.  CO2 Emissions per capita - the total CO2 emissions divided by the population in 2021.  Cumulative CO2 emissions over history.  The change in atmostpheric CO2 due to land use. This can be positive or negative - if countries plant more trees, for example, that would reduce atmospheric CO2, while clearing land or changing how it is used can increase emissions.  CO2 emissions from land use per capita.  Share of CO2 emissions in 2021, as a percentage of global emissions in 2021.  Share of cumulative global CO2 emissions over time, as a percentage of cumulative global emissions.  Share of temperature change from greenhouse gas emissions. Certain changes or types of emissions can have larger effects on temperature change, so this may be different that then the percentage of CO2 emissions.  Use the data in the spreadsheet to answer these questions:  Create a graph of the total CO2 emissions of the 10 countries with the highest emissions in the list. What kind of graph did you choose to make and why?  Create a graph which shows the percentage share of CO2 that each continent or region (the continents\/regions listed are Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America) has emitted. What kind of graph did you choose to make and why?  Taking all the countries with populations smaller than the USA, create a graph which shows the relationship between population and the percentage of CO2 emissions which the country is responsible for. What kind of graph did you choose and why? Does there seem to be a relationship between the size of the country and the percentage of CO2 emissions they're responsible for.      Use the data from Emissions by Country\/Region to answer the following questions:  What kind of data is the variable land_use_change_co2_per_capita , which gives the per capita CO2 emissions due to land use change for each country or region?  This variable gives the CO2 emissions from changes in land use, like clearing of land for agriculture or housing, open-pit mining, or elimination of wetlands. The values for per capita land use CO2 emissions range from -3.674 tons per person (Vanuatu) to 8.483 tons per person (Bhutan). Explain why you would need to use a histogram to display this data.  Create a frequency table using intervals of width 1 ( ) for per capita land use emissions from the countries listed in the data - you can omit continents, regions, and groupings of countries by income.  Use the frequency table you created in to create a histogram of the per capita land use emissions for the countries.  What does the histogram tell you? Are there a lot of countries with positive land use emissions per capita, or very few? Do most countries have positive or negative emissions per capita? What does this histogram tell you about how we should focus our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from land use?  We built our histogram for per capita land use change CO2 emissions. The table also has overall land use change CO2 emissions for each country (the land_use_change_co2 variable). Why is it easier to create a histogram for the land use per capita data than the overall land use CO2 emissions? Why is it more useful to use per capita data to understand patterns in emissions than overall land use CO2 totals?      The data in USA CO2 Emissions gives the CO2 emissions (in millions of tons) and per capita CO2 emissions (in tons per person) for the USA for each year since 1800 . Use the data to answer the following questions:  Create a graph of the CO2 emissions from 1800 to 2022. What kind of graph did you use and why?  Use the same kind of graph to graph the per capita CO2 emissions from 1800 to 2022. How are the patterns in the graph similar to those in ? How are they different?  CO2 emissions rose steadily in the USA until 2005, with some notable exceptions. Look at the graphs and the data to find at least two periods where CO2 emissions dropped for multiple years in a row. What was going on in the USA when this occurred that could have caused the reduction in emissions?  Since 2005, CO2 emissions have fallen in the USA. Using your own research, list a few possible explanations for what has caused this reduction in emissions.      Use the data provided in to create a graph for each of the following questions. Explain why you chose to create the graph that you did and how it helped you answer the question.  Are the continental regions which have contributed the most to cumulative global emissions the same ones that are currently contributing most to global emissions?  Do countries that have high CO2 emissions per capita also have high CO2 emissions from land use per capita?  Do countries with higher incomes have higher per capita CO2 emissions?  Which countries have the highest per capita emissions?      The file at CO2 Levels and Temperature Anomalies (Data from and ) gives the following data for every year since 1959:  The mean annual CO2 level recorded at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii in parts per million (ppm).  The mean annual global temperature anomaly gives the number of degrees Celsius that the mean global temperature differs from the mean temperature during the years 1901-2000. If the temperature in a year was exactly average for the 20th century, then the anomaly would be 0. If it is higher than the average for the 20th century, it will be greater than 0 - and less than 0 if it is lower.  Create a graph of the relationship between CO2 levels and the global temperature anomaly. Explain why you chose the graph you did. Does there appear to be a relationship between global CO2 levels and a rise in temperature?    The two graphs shown below in both use the data from CO2 Levels and Temperature Anomalies .    Graph of CO2 levels and mean temperature anomaly where the CO2 level axis goes from 300 to 440 and the temperature anomaly axis goes from -0.3 to 6.0.  Graph of CO2 levels and mean temperature anomaly where the CO2 level axis goes from 300 to 440 and the temperature anomaly axis goes from -0.3 to 1.2.   Two graphs of the same data on CO2 levels and global mean temperature anomaly.   Answer the following questions about these graphs:  In the first graph in , does it look like CO2 is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? What about the temperature anomaly?  In the second graph in , does it look like CO2 is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same? What about the temperature anomaly?  From looking at the first graph in , what conclusion might you draw about the relationship between CO2 levels and temperature? What about from the second graph in ?  What makes the two graphs in look so different, even though they show the same data?  These graphs - usually called dual axis charts are frequently used in misleading ways.

  "body": " Understanding the Issue   Interest and Risk   Interest  An amount of money, usually a percentage of the amount owed, which is added on to a debt which has not been paid. Usually interest is added on once a month or once a year. The percentage is called the interest rate .   Banks charge different interest rates in different situations. For example, if you already have a lot of money borrowed from other banks, a bank may charge you a higher interest rate. They do this because they are less confident that you will be able to pay the loaned money back, an idea called risk .   Risk  The probability that the amount of money a bank makes on a loan or other investment is less than the amount of money that they loaned out.   The risk of a loan is determined using a number of factors - the two most important are the borrower's credit score and whether the loan is secured or not.   Credit Score  A credit score is a number, used in the United States and a number of other countries, which assigns a number (between 300 and 850) to a person's credit risk. Higher numbers indicate lower risk.     A bar with credit scores ranging from Very Bad to Excellent. Image Description available.   \"FICO Credit Score Range\" by cafecredit is licensed with CC BY 2.0 . Image Description .   Credit scores are determined by mathematical algorithms, and are based on many different factors. We'll look at how they're determined in . The general principle of credit scores is that you are more likely to repay a loan if you have repaid other loans in the past. While this may seem like a reasonable system at face-value, it can create huge problems for people who haven't had access to loans in the past.  The other main factor that affects risk is whether the loan is secured . When you secure a loan, that means that you offer up something of value to guarantee that you will pay back the loan. If you fail to pay back the loan, the lender can reposess whatever you offered up. Large purchases - like cars or homes - are generally made on secured loans. If you fail to pay back the loan, the lending agency will take back the car or home which you borrowed the money for.    Types of Loans and Lenders   This module is primarily concerned with understanding how payday loans work. On the surface, payday loans may seem like a pretty good deal - but when carefully compared with other types of loans, we'll see that they can actually end up costing the borrower a lot of money. We'll look at how they compare to other types of loans that are available to people with better credit scores    Payday Loans    Window of a payday lender advertising loans of $50 to $500 with no credit check.   \"Payday Loan Place Window Graphics\" by taberandrew is licensed with CC BY 2.0 .   Payday loans are a type of loan often called a \"loan of last resort.\" Anyone can take out a payday loan - the lender does not check their credit score to determine risk. Therefore, the lender must assume that everyone taking out a payday loan is high risk - even though that may not be true. Payday loans are generally made for a short term, usually two weeks (the name comes from taking a loan until the next payday, when it can be paid back). At the end of the two weeks, the borrower must pay back the amount they borrowed plus a fee. Payday loans are usually for small amounts - up to $1000 - and charge a fee of $10-$30 for each $100 borrowed [ ]. So you might borrow $200 and pay it back two weeks later, plus a $30 fee. While this may not seem like much, this is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 360% - almost 20 times what a credit card might charge! In we'll see how to compute how much interest a payday loan is charging.    A short explanation of how payday lending works from the Pew Charitable Trust.     Bank Loans  Traditional bank loans are very different than a payday loan. The interest rate is determined by risk (credit score), the type of loan, and what kind of security the borrower can offer for the loan. Bank loans will have much lower interest rates than payday loans, but are not available to everyone. Many people get their first loan - when they don't have a credit history - by having someone else cosign it. A cosigner is someone, usually a parent or other relative, who agrees to pay back the loan if the borrower cannot. Student loans are an example of a type of loan that often has a cosigner - if the borrower is a student, they may not have the credit history or security to borrow on their own.  One popular type of bank loan, used by many consumers, is the credit card. A credit card is effectively an agreement between the bank and the cardholder to loan any amount of money on a short-term basis, up to a certain amount - called the credit limit . The cardholder agrees to pay back at least the interest on the loan each month, or pay a penalty. If the cardholder doesn't make their minimum payment each month, in addition to the penalty fees, the bank can cancel the credit card. Falling behind on paying a credit card can quickly add up - both in fees and in damage to your credit rating. If you have a high credit score, banks will usually agree to give you a credit card with a low interest rate. If your credit score isn't as good, though, they will either deny you a card entirely, offer you one with a high interest rate, or require you to secure the card (pay a deposit to cover any missed payments).  Many people take out bank loans to make major purchases, like homes or cars. A mortgage is a bank loan which uses a home or piece of property as a security. Many people use a mortgage to borrow money to buy a home. If they fail to repay the loan, the bank gets to take the security - in this case, their home. When the bank takes the security from the loan, it is called a foreclosure (usually used with homes and property) or a reposession (usually used with vehicles like cars or boats). The result is the same - the bank takes the property which was used to secure the loan. They are then able to sell that property to earn back the money that they loaned out. Interest rates for these types of loans tend to be much lower, because the opportunity to foreclose on the property gives the bank a way to earn their money back even if the borrower does not repay the loan.    Government Loans  The government - both state and federal governments in the US - is also an important provider of loans. These loans are either provided directly by the government or secured by the government (a private bank makes the loan, and the government provides the security for the borrower). In some cases - like subsidized student loans - the government may even pay part of the interest. Government loans provide access to money for people in need, but the process for getting one can be complicated and take time. In addition, many government loans are restricted to particular groups, like veterans, small businesses, or first-time college students.  Some government loans can be forgiven , meaning that the government does not require the loan to be paid back in exchange for some form of service from the borrower. For example, government student loans can be forgiven after ten years of work in public service, as long as certain requirements are met.    Pawn  A pawn is a short-term secured loan, usually made to someone with a low or no credit score. In a pawn, the borrower brings a valuable object (usually something small, like jewelry or electronics) to a pawn shop. The pawnbroker pays them some percentage of the value of the item, generally less than half. The borrower must then repay the amount, plus interest. If the borrower doesn't pay the money back, the pawnbroker can sell their item to recoup their investment.  Pawns generally offer more favorable interest rates than payday loans, since the loan is secured. However, the borrower loses the ability to use whatever they have pawned while the money is borrowed. For something like jewelry, that can mean living with the anxiety of losing a valuable or sentimental item. For something like electronics, it could impact their ability to communicate or work.     Discriminatory Lending  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is a federal law in the United States which prohibits discrimination in the loaning of money and other credit transactions . The ECOA prohibits discrimination on the basis of  Race or color;  Religion;  National origin;  Sex;  Marital Status;  Age;  Source of income;  Excercise of consumer credit rights.    So if the ECOA exists, banks are unable to discriminate against different types of people, right? Unfortunately, no. While the ECOA makes it illegal to discriminate in mortgage lending, enforcement of the law is very challenging. It is very difficult to prove, in a situation where so many different factors are involved, that race or national origin influenced the lenders decision. Many lenders use complex computer algorithms to decide whether to lend to a particular borrower. Frequently, these algorithms are trained in a process called machine learning , where the computer studies data from past loans. The computer finds patterns in the data, and uses those patterns to make decision about whether to lend and what terms to offer. Because that data is based on past lending decisions made by human beings, it can (and does) contain biased decisions made by those human beings. Research has shown that these algorithms replicate the patterns of racial and ethnic discrimination that were made in the data they are trained on. Therefore, although overt discrimination is forbidden in lending, it still occurs.  In addition to the discrimination that occurs through implicit bias (both in humans and in algorithms), the ECOA, and other similar laws in different countries, still allow banks and other lenders to discriminate on the basis of risk. Banks can choose whether or not they want to lend someone money based on how likely that person is to pay it back.  We've talked about how banks, the government, and other entities make decisions about who they will loan money to. Those decisions are made primarily on the basis of two things: credit history and access to security. If someone has a strong credit history - they have borrowed money and paid it back on time - or if they have access to property or someone with credit history to secure their loan - then they can obtain favorable terms for a loan. If they do not have either of those things, then they are left to borrow money from lenders who demand much higher interest payments.  This brings us to the question, then, of which groups of people have access to those things. Although the ECOA banned discrimination in the loaning of money in 1974, access to credit tends to be passed down through generations. If your grandparents did not have access to credit, they may not have been able to support your parents when they needed to borrow money for education or a first home - in which case, your parents would be unable to offer the same opportunities to you.  Thus, the question of who has access to affordable credit can become a question of who has access to generational wealth. Wealth is defined as the value of a family's assets - both money saved in bank accounts and investments as well as property like homes and cars - minus their debt. Studies have shown that Black Americans (as well as other people of color) have far less wealth than white Americans. In 2016, a study found that the median wealth of Black households was less than 10% of that of similar white households . Wealth tends to accumulate in families over time. This can be direct, like inheritance, where one generation receives wealth (money or property) directly from the previous one. It can also be indirect. For example, a college student may indirectly inherit generational wealth when their parents pay for part or all of their college, or when they win a scholarship from opportunities provided by their parents. This allows them to avoid taking on debt to pay for college, which would decrease their overall wealth. This accumulated wealth, then, gives them greater opportunities to credit in their future. The effect of generational wealth can be seen in the paradoxical relationship between wealth and debt in America. Even though they have 10 times the median wealth, white households have median debt which is more than twice as high as Black households . The debt held by white households, though, tends to be less costly than that held by Black households. Much of this discrepancy is due to access to cheaper forms of debt like home mortgages, home equity loans, and student loans. Black households tend to hold more of their debt in more expensive forms of credit like credit card debt and installment loans.  On the surface, payday loans are available to anyone. Because wealthier and white households tend to have access to other forms of credit, payday loans tend to be used primarily by poorer households and people of color. People who do not own their own home are 57% more likely to use payday loans than homeowners. People without a 4-year college degree are 82% more likely to use payday loans than those with degrees. Race, though, was the greatest predictor of whether someone had used a payday loan - Blacks were more than twice as likely (105% more likely) to have used a payday loan as individuals of other races and ethnicities, even after controlling for other factors like income level and homeownership . If access to credit were only determined by risk - factors like income and access to security - we could expect the percentage of white and Black borrowers to be similar.  In addition to the obstacles imposed by lending discrimination and lack of generational wealth, there are other reasons why people would turn to predatory forms of lending. One very simple reason is where they live.  A study in 2019 found that there are simply fewer banks in majority Black neighborhoods. In areas where the majority of residents were white, there was an average of 41 banks & other financial institutions per 100,000 people. In majority non-white neighborhoods, that number fell to 27 per 100,000. Furthermore, banks in majority Black neighborhoods tended to charge higher fees than those in majority white neighborhoods .  The lack of banks in majority Black neighborhoods is mirrored by a greater concentration of payday lenders. A 2016 study in California found that the neighborhoods where payday lenders were concentrated were much more likely to be majority Black or Latinx . A 2020 survey found that Black respondents were more than twice as likely to say that they lived within one mile of a payday lender . This lack of access to low-interest lenders, coupled with easy access to high-interest lenders, is called reverse redlining . Redlining was the (now illegal) practice of singling out minority neighborhoods for mortgage discrimination, denying loans to people buying homes in those neighborhoods. Redlining is considered a major contributor to the generational wealth gap between Black and white americans. Similarly, reverse redlining creates neighborhoods without access to low-interest credit - not because of bank policies, per se, but because of physical proximity to lending institutions.    We've learned a lot about payday lenders - how they operate, why people use them, where they are, and what they do. Now that we understand the sociological aspects of the issue, let's dive into the mathematics. Mathematics can help us understand just how unfair payday lending is, how these lenders turn a profit, and study the inequity in where payday lenders are located. We'll learn the mathematics we need to analyze these issues, and then dive into some deeper exploration of the inequity of payday lending.   "

They also found that the payday lenders had ties to many of the large Wall Street investment banks, either through partial ownership or through shared personnel.   "

What are resources that can be provided to help people avoid predatory lending?   In order to help people avoid predatory lending, we first need to figure out what predatory lending is. We'll look at how we can compare different loans using interest rates - even if they're not clearly spelled out information we're given.  We'll talk about how high interest rates can be disguised as fees or rolled into payments. We'll discuss the different possible ways that companies can mislead consumers about the cost of their products.  We'll look at the concept of risk and expected value. Predatory lending is based on the idea that higher risk borrowers - those less likely to be able to repay the loan - must pay higher interest rates. But how high is too high?  We'll look at reverse redlining - where are payday lenders located? Do the patterns that were seen in California reappear in other places? How can we look at data and see where payday lenders are more likely to be?  Finally, we'll discuss what can be done to help people avoid predatory lending. Are there laws which can be passed? Can community organizations help people find non-predatory lenders? How can we help people access credit from non-predatory sources?  "

  "title": "Simple and Compound Interest",
  "body": " Simple and Compound Interest   There are two main types of interest - simple and compound. Let's look at the mathematics involved in calculating each. Then we'll see how we can use this mathematics to look at payday loans.    Simple Interest  Mathematically, interest is computed by taking a percentage of the principal. We can think about interest from two perspectives. From the perspective of the bank or the person loaning the money, they are making an investment - they give someone a certain amount of money, with the expectation that they will be paid back more money in the future. From the perspective of the borrower, this money (or the object that they bought with it, like a house or a car) is a loan - they will repay more back in the future than what they borrowed.    Stacks of money getting higher with an arrow drawn along the tops of the increasing stacks.   \"rising-interest-rates-new-image1\" by bhautikjoshi is licensed with CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 .    Simple Interest  If you invest a principle at an APR (written as a decimal) for a given number of years, the investment will now be worth:   This can also be written, using variables, as   Here, is the amount the investment is worth, is the principle, is the APR (written as a decimal), and is the amount of time that the loan is made for.   Simple interest is usually used for transactions between friends and family or for certain types of loans, like automobile purchases. It is used because it is easy to calculate and understand.  Here are some examples for you to try:    Susan's parents loan them $1000 to help them move into a new apartment. They ask that Susan pay the money back in 2 years with 4% simple interest. How much will they owe?    4%, written as a decimal, is . So using the formula above, we get that Susan owes their parents       Fernando purchases a $20,000 car. The dealership loans them the money to buy the car at a 3.85% simple interest, for 5 years. How much will Fernando need to pay each month to pay off the car in 5 years?    First compute how much Fernando owes total. How many monthly payments will there be?    The total amount that Fernando owes is:   Since they are paying off the debt over 5 years, they will make monthly payments. Assuming that all of the monthly payments are the same, Fernando will need to pay       Compound Interest  Most lenders actually use a different way of calculating interest, called compound interest . In compound interest, rather than just taking a percentage of the amount once, interest is calculated regularly - every day, month, year, or some other unit of time. This causes interest to accumulate more rapidly, since you are taking a percentage not just of the original amount, but also of any interest that has already been added on.  For example, imagine you borrow $100 at 5% interest for 10 years. With simple interest, you would add 5% of $100 - $5 - each year for 10 years, for a total of $50 worth of interest. You would end up owing $150 after 10 years. If you were paying 5% interest compounded annually , though, you would take 5% of the amount each year - including any interest that has already accumulated.   5% interest compounded annually.    Year  Total Amount Owed with Interest    0  100    1  105 = 100 + 100*0.05    2  110.25 = 105 + 105*0.05    3  115.76 = 110.25 + 110.25*0.05    4  121.55 = 115.76 + 115.76*0.05    5  127.63 = 121.55 + 121.55*0.05    6  134.01 = 127.63 + 127.63*0.05    7  140.71 = 134.01 + 134.01*0.05    8  147.75 = 140.71 + 140.71*0.05    9  155.13 = 147.75 + 147.75*0.05    10  162.89 = 155.13 + 155.13*0.05     If we were using simple interest to calculate the amount owed here, after 10 years, we would owe The additional $12.89 is interest which is being paid on the interest!  $12 may not seem like that big of a deal (although it can be, for people who are really struggling), but compound interest adds up much faster when the amount borrowed or the interest rate is larger. Even a small increase in the interest rate can have a huge effect on the amount owed at the end of the loan.  Creating this table isn't hard, but it is time-consuming. One of the most important parts of mathematics is looking for patterns in numbers that we can use to save time. In this formula, we can see that each time we take the previous amount and add 0.05 times that amount:    Notice that this is the same thing as multiplying the previous amount by 1.05    Multiplying by the same amount at every step gets us an exponential relationship. We have     All together, this suggests a faster way to get any of the values in the table above, by using an exponential equation. After n years, we will owe dollars. This gives us an equation for the amount of money owed when interest is computed annually.  In general, though, lenders can charge interest as often as they like. Interest is frequently compounded monthly (12 times a year) or daily (365 times a year). In these cases, we use basically the same formula - with two main changes.  If you pay 12% interest over the year, but you're being charged interest each month, you wouldn't pay 12% interest every month! Instead, we divide the interest rate by the number of times we compound each year. 12% annual interest would become monthly interest. If we were compounding daily, we would have daily interest.  We also need to increase the power on our exponent. If you compute interest every month for 10 years, you're computing interest 12*10 = 120 times overall. If you're compounding daily, you would have 365*10 = 3650 times overall.  Making these two changes gives us our formula for Compound Interest.   Compound Interest  If you invest a principle at an APR (written as a decimal) for a given number of years, compounded times per year, the investment will now be worth:   This can also be written, using variables, as   Here, is the amount the investment is worth, is the principle, is the APR (written as a decimal), is the number of times interest is compounded each year, and is the amount of time that the loan is made for.   This exponential growth is what makes a small change to the interest rate such a big deal. Let's look at two loans - both for $1000, compounded monthly, over a period of 10 years. One lender charges an APR of 4%, while the other lender charges 7%. Let's see how much you owe at the end of 10 years using each formula:  Even though 7% is only a small amount large than 4%, it makes a huge difference - over $500 - in how much you owe at the end of the loan. Increasing the loan to 10% makes an even bigger difference:  Here are some examples for you to try:   Tasha borrows $2000 at 14% interest, compounded monthly. How much will they owe in a year?    We can tell this is compound interest because it says compounded. Figure out which numbers go where in the formula.    Tasha will owe       Diego borrowed money at a 15% interest rate for 5 years, compounded daily. If they had to pay back $3000, how much did they borrow originally?    In this example, what are we looking for? Put everything else into the compound interest formula and solve for the missing variable.    We know what Diego has to pay back (A in the formula), but we don't know what he borrowed in the first place (P in the formula). So we have:   Diego only borrowed $1417.32 at the beginning of the 5 years. They paid back over twice as much as they borrowed.      Finding the Interest Rate  One of the ways that payday lenders conceal how much interest they're charging is by charging a \"fee\" instead of an interest rate. For example, a payday lender may loan someone $200 for two weeks. When they pay the money back, they charge them a $20 fee.  In this example, $20 may not seem like a lot - it's only 10% of the $200 that they borrowed. Remember, though, that when we talk about interest rates, we talk about annual percentage rates. This is 10% over two weeks - if you don't pay the $20 at the end of the first two weeks, you'll be charged another $20 at the end of the next two weeks! There are 52 weeks in the year, so by the end of the year (26 two-week periods) you would have paid in interest - that's of the amount you borrowed! The annual percentage rate is 260%!  Notice that this is simple interest - the amount of interest that they charge you each time didn't change (it was $20 every two weeks). Most payday lenders work this way - every two weeks you pay the fee until you can pay back the original money you borrowed. The fees vary, but are usually between $10 and $30 per $100 borrowed every two weeks.  You can use the simple interest formula to figure out what the equivalent annual interest rate is. Remember that when you use the formula, the time is always in years, so 2 weeks would equal of a year. Say you borrow $300 and pay a $25 fee per $100 for every two weeks. You'll owe at the end of the two weeks, so the simple interest formula gives you:    The equivalent annual percentage rate is 650%.  How much would you owe after two weeks if you borrowed the same money on a credit card which charges 22% interest, compounded daily? Here we use the compound interest formula. Even though 22% is a pretty high interest rate for a credit card, you'll still end up paying a lot less than the payday loan:   At 22%, compounded daily, you end up just paying $2.55 in interest after 2 weeks.

  "title": "Risk and Credit Scores",
  "body": " Risk and Credit Scores   When we talked about lending in the introduction, we discussed the credit score . Your credit score is a number - usually between 300 and 850 in the United States - which tells a lender how likely you are to repay borrowed money. We can think of a credit score in terms of probability.    Introduction to Probability  The probability of a particular event occurring is a number between 0 and 1 (or, equivalently, between 0% and 100%) which measures how likely that event is to occur. If something has a probability of 0, that means it will never happen. If it has a probability of 1, then it will always happen, no matter what.  Usually, when we study probability, we talk about simple situations where it's easy to determine the probability. For example, if you roll a 6-sided die, the probability that you get a 6 is because you're looking at 1 possibility out of 6 total.  However, in the real world, probabilities are usually much more complicated to determine. To calculate your credit score, credit reporting agencies use many different factors - how long you've had loans or credit cards, how many times you have been late paying your bills, and the types of loans and credit cards that you have. There is no simple formula to calculate how likely you are to repay a loan. The credit score summarizes the complicated calculations that have gone into determining the likelihood of you paying back money that you borrow.  Although it is an oversimplification of the actual situation, we'll use the credit score as a simple measure of probability so that we can see an example of how it works. We'll treat a score of 300 - the lowest score - as meaning that the probability you pay back a loan is 0%. We'll say that a credit score of 850 means that there is a 100% chance that you pay back the loan on time. We'll treat every score between as a number between 0 and 100% using the formula So a credit score of 700, in our simplification would mean a chance of repaying the loan on time.    Expected Value  Once banks determine how likely you are to repay a loan, they can make a decision about whether they will loan you money, whether that's as a student loan, credit card, or something else. They use the credit score to determine the amount of money they can expect to make off of the loan. If you don't repay the loan, they will lose all of the money that they loaned you. If you do repay the loan, then they make money - in the form of the interest that you pay back on the loan. This is called the expected value of the loan. It depends on both the probability that a borrower will pay back the loan, the amount of money being borrowed, and the amount of interest that the bank will make off of the loan.  Before we look at the expected value of a loan, let's define the expected value in general. Expected value works by using the probability to weight the reward of different events happening. Consider this example: Say a friend makes you an offer. They'll flip a coin. If the coin comes up heads, they'll pay you $1. If the coin comes up tails, you pay them $1.  If you play the game just once, you'll end up either $1 richer or $1 poorer - there's a 50% chance of either. If you play it twice, you either win both, win the first and lose the second, lose the first and win the second, or lose both - so there are 4 possibilities. If you win both times, you're $2 richer. If you win one and lose one (either of the middle two situations) you're back where you started - $0 richer. If you lose both, you're $2 poorer. If you average out the different scenarios, you end up exactly where you started - there's exactly the same chance of winning money as losing. So we say the expected value is $0 - on average, we don't expect to end up with any more money than we started with.  Expected value depends on probability - so it certainly isn't saying that if you play that game with your friend, you won't win any money! You could play 10 times and win every time...it just isn't very likely (the chance of that happening is a little less than 1\/1000)   Expected Value  Suppose you have multiple different possible events, each with some probability of occurring, and each with some \"reward\" our \"benefit\" (penalties or losses are represented as negative rewards). Then the expected value is found by taking the probability of each event times the reward of that event, and adding them up: where P(event) is the probability of the event, and R(event) is the reward. You can continue this for more than 2 events - just multiply the probability times the reward and add it on.  The expected value tells you, on average, how much you can expect to \"win\" each time an event happens, by averaging out the wins and losses.   Let's look at an example of how this works, using insurance as an example. When an insurance company sells you insurance, they calculate the probability that you will use it - and how much they'll have to pay you if you do use it. If you don't use the insurance, they \"win\" the amount of money that you pay for the insurance - if you do use it, they lose whatever they have to pay out for the claim (minus whatever you paid them). On average, over lots and lots of customers, they'll earn the expected value from each customer. Let's look at an example.  An insurance company calculates that there is a 1% chance that a driver has a car accident each year, and that on average they will have to pay $15,000 per accident. They charge $600 a year for insurance. How much can they expect to earn, on average, from each customer?  The probability of having an accident is 1% (0.01), which means that the probability of not having an accident is 99% (0.99). If you have an accident, the insurance company loses $15,000, minus the $600 you paid them, for a net \"reward\" of . If you don't have an accident, they earn a \"reward\" of $600 - the amount you paid for your insurance. The expected value, then is: On average, they can expect to earn $450 per customer that they sell insurance to.  Give it a try yourself - here are some examples to work out.    An insurance company charges $2000 a year for home insurance. There is a 2% chance each year that a homeowner will make a claim, and the insurance company will need to pay them $23,000. What is the expected value?    What is the probability that they have to pay money out? How much will they lose if they do (remember they get to keep the money that was paid for the insurance policy)?    The probability that they will have to pay is 2% = 0.02. If they do have to pay, they will lose $23,000 minus the $2000 they charged the customer, for a total of $21,000. There is a 98% = 0.98 chance that they don't have to pay, in which case they'll earn $2000 from the customer's premium. The expected value for the insurance company is On average, they can expect to earn $1540 per customer.    Let's look at example explicitly about how payday lenders operate. Most payday lenders make their money because people renew their loans week after week, paying larger fees to borrow the money for a longer period of time.    A payday lender loans you $200 with a $30 fee, to be paid back in 2 weeks. If you don't pay it back in 2 weeks, you'll be charged another $30 fee, and another $30 for each 2 weeks after that. They think that there is a 10% chance you'll pay it back in 2 weeks, a 20% chance you'll pay it back in 4 weeks, a 60% chance you'll pay it back in 6 weeks, and a 10% chance you won't pay it back at all. What is the expected value of the loan for the lender?    Think about how much the payday lender earns (or loses) in each case.    There are 4 different situations here. If you pay the loan back in 2 weeks (10% chance), the lender earns $30. If you pay it back in 4 weeks (20% chance), they earn $60. If you pay it back in 6 weeks (60% chance), they earn $90. If you don't pay it back (10% chance), they lose $200. The expected value is On average, they can expect to earn $49 per customer.      How Banks Make Lending Decisions  Banks use the idea of risk to make decisions about how much money they will lend. We'll look at a simplified example of how this works, though the reality is, of course, more complicated. This will still give you an idea, fundamentally of how it works.  Say that you want to borrow $1000 from a bank via an unsecured loan. If the loan were secured, and you didn't pay it back, the bank could seize your house or car or whatever you had secured the loan with. Since it's unsecured, the bank will lose all of the money that they loaned you if you don't pay it back. Therefore, they want to make the expected value of loaning you money positive (for them) - that is, they want to ensure that on average the money that you pay them in interest makes up for the risk of you not paying the loan back.  Let's look at the situation where the bank loans you $1000 for 1 year, simple interest, and let's assume that they decide there's a 10% chance you don't pay the loan off. If the interest rate is r , the expected value calculations look like this:  Expected Value for a $1000 loan for 1 year with 10% risk of default    Rate (r)  Amount of Interest  Expected Value    0.02  $20     0.03  $30     0.04  $40     0.05  $50     0.06  $60     0.07  $70     0.08  $80     0.09  $90     0.10  $100     0.11  $110     0.12  $120     The bank would need to charge at least 12% interest to be guaranteed to make money. In practice, a bank would charge considerably more interest for an unsecured loan if there were such a large chance they would get none of the money back - if they would loan it at all. If you don't pay back your loan, your bank will sell the debt to a debt collector - who will pay them what they think the loan is worth, usually a fraction of the loan. The debt collector will then attempt to get the money back through legal actions like lawsuits and garnished wages.    You apply for a loan of $10,000 from a bank. They compute that there is a 1% chance that you won't pay the loan back, in which case they'll sell it to a debt collector for $5000. What is the expected value for the bank if they charge you 4.25% interest, simple interest, and you pay the loan back in 2 years?    What does the bank gain if you pay the loan back? What do they lose if you don't?    There are 2 different situations here - either you don't pay the loan back in 2 years, or you do. If you don't (1% chance), then the bank loses $5000 (they loaned you $10,000, and the debt collector only paid them $5,000). If you do pay it back (99% chance), then the bank gains the interest you paid back. After 2 years of 4.25% simple interest, you pay the bank back The bank earned $850 (they loaned you $10,000, and got $10,850 back). The expected value for the bank is If they made many loans like this, on average, they would earn $791.50 per customer.    Let's do a more complicated example, with compound interest.    The bank is considering loaning you $5,000, at a rate of 8.75%, compounded monthly, to be paid back after 3 years. They calculate that there is a 2% chance you won't pay the loan back, and they'll have to sell the debt to a debt collector for $3000. What is the expected value for the bank?    Figure out how much the bank will earn on the loan if you pay it back in full, with interest, after 3 years.    If you pay the loan back, you'll pay the bank This is $1494.69 more than the bank loaned you, so in this situation, they \"win\" $1494.69. If you don't pay the loan back, they lose $2000, because they can only sell the loan to a debt collector for $3000. Thus, the expected value is: The bank can expect to earn, on average, $1424.80 on each loan like this.     "

  "title": "Correlation",
  "body": " Correlation   Our final mathematical topic for this module will be correlation. When we looked at the background of payday lenders, we talked about the fact that they are more likely to be located in majority Black and Latinx neighborhoods. We'll look at analyzing this mathematically through the lens of correlation.    Defining the Correlation  Suppose we have two sets of numbers:  If someone told you that the next number in the first set was 30, what would you expect the next number in the second set to be? You would probably guess 60, because there's a clear pattern here - the number in the second series is always exactly double the corresponding number in the first series.  In practice, when we look at two sets of data, the relationship between them is rarely this exact. For example, look at these two sets of data:  The values in the second set are just a little bit off from two times as much as the first set. If someone told you the next number in the first set was 30, though, you would still probably expect the next number in the second set to be approximately 60 - maybe not exactly 60, but something close. Even though one number doesn't exactly predict the other, it comes pretty close.  The correlation is a way of measuring how closely one set of numbers predict another. The correlation gives a number between 1 and -1. A correlation of 0 means that there is absolutely no relationship between the two sets of numbers - when one changes, you can't predict what will happen to the other. A correlation of 1 means that there is a perfect relationship between the numbers - when the values in the first data set increase, the values in the second data set increases in a way that exactly corresponds. Our first two sets of numbers would have a correlation of 1. Our second pair would have a correlation close to 1, but not exactly 1. A correlation of -1 also indicates a perfect relationship, but when one of the values in one set increases, the values in the second set will decrease in a way that exactly corresponds. So the pattern is still perfect, but it works in reverse.  Computing the correlation is tricky. We'll go through the process of computing it, which takes multiple steps, but in general we'll do it using software. The R programming language lets us easily find the correlation between two sets of numbers. Here, you'll see the two data sets we looked at above. The cor function in R calculates the correlation between two sets of numbers - hit \"Evaluate R\" to calculate. You can try different values in the exercise below - just hit \"Evaluate R\" to find the correlation. You'll see that when we look at the first pair of data sets, the correlation is exactly 1: If we look at the second pair, though, the correlation is a little less than 1. 0.9812022 is still very close to 1, though, because these numbers still mostly fit the pattern - just not perfectly.  If we have numbers that are completely unrelated, though - where there is no pattern between how much one increases by and the other - we'll see very low correlation:     Computing Correlation  Computing the correlation is a little complicated, and is easiest done in multiple steps. While it's not crucial that you can go through all of these steps on your own, we'll explain how the correlation is defined to help understand why it computes how related two sets of data are.   Correlation  If we have two sets of data and with the same number of values, the correlation is where and are the means of and , and and are the sample standard deviations of and .  You can compute the mean by adding up all the values and dividing by .   You can compute the sample standard deviation by subtracting the mean from each value, squaring that, adding them all up, dividing by , and taking the square root.    This is a pretty complicated formula, but it turns out it's pretty easy to break it down into steps.  Compute the means and .  Compute the sample standard deviations and .  Subtract the mean from each value in , and the mean from each value in .  Multiply the corresponding differences from and together.  Add them all up.  Divide the whole thing by .    Let's see how this works with the second data set above:    First we'll compute the means and sample standard deviations of each data set:      Now that we have all of these, let's get down to the work of calculating the correlation. Our next step is to subtract the mean from each data value in and :    Now we'll multiply each corresponding pair together:   Now we'll add up all the values:   And finally, we divide by .   This is the same value we got from R above, up to 3 decimal places (the difference comes because we rounded and )    Using Correlation  Ok, so we've defined this correlation, which tells us how one set of numbers is related to another. But why does it matter?  An old adage says that \"correlation does not imply causation,\" meaning that just because two things are correlated doesn't mean that change to one causes the change in another. Two things could be correlated that are completely unrelated. For example, there is a strong correlation (0.9039) between the number of bee colonies in the US and the divorce rate in South Carolina:    The number of honey-producing bee colonies in the US correlates with the divorce rate in South Carolina   Does this mean that bees are breaking up marriages in South Carolina, or that new divorcees are running out to start beekeeping? Of course not (or at least, probably not). We don't have any other reason to believe that one of these variables is causing the other. But when there is some reason why we might believe that one thing is causing another, the correlation can give us evidence to support that theory.    Correlation does not imply causation.   For example, because of the legacy of systemic racism and intentional exclusion of Black Americans from the financial system, we could theorize that there are fewer banks - and more payday lenders - in majority Black neighborhoods. We could use correlation to see if there is evidence for this theory - by looking at the racial makeup of a neighborhood and seeing if there is a correlation with the number of financial institutions. This doesn't prove that banks are intentionally avoiding Black neighborhoods (though other evidence may support that claim) - it just provides evidence to support that theory.   "

  "body": " Solving for Change   Now that we understand interest rates, risk, and correlation, we can begin to really look at the problem of predatory lending. The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) tracks payday lending across the country. Using a $300 loan, they calculated the annual percentage rate that you would pay in interest in each state of the United States. Note that some of the states have no rate listed - those states have passed laws which make predatory lending unprofitable.    Map of the United States with typical payday loan APR. Image description available.   Payday lending rates by state. States with no percentage listed have passed laws effectively outlawing predatory payday lending, usually by banning interest rates over a particular level (Minnesota's ban goes into effect on 1\/1\/2024). Calculations are based on a $400 loan in June 2023. Image adapted from work by Spitfire19, CC BY 1.0 , via Wikimedia Commons. The adapted image is by Mark Branson CC BY-NC 4.0 . Data from . Image Description .   All of these rates are unfair and predatory, but some of them are appalling. In Texas, payday lenders charge up to 664% interest on a $300 loan - that means that over the course of a year, if you borrow $300, you end up paying back   That's $1,992 in interest on a $300 loan - about $75 every two weeks. Payday lenders tend to break their loans down into smaller amounts in order to make it seem like less. Rather than saying $1,992 in interest every year, or even $75 every two weeks on a $300 loan, they would say, \"Our fee is $25 for every $100 you borrow, paid back after two weeks.\" If that 2 weeks ends, and you can't re-pay the loan...another $25 for every $100 is charged. For a borrower struggling to make ends meet, the fees add up like clockwork.  Lenders make many arguments about why they should be able to charge these rates. Sometimes they say that because people are willing to pay their rates, they should be able to charge them - if it were too much, no one would pay them. They say that they have to charge such high interest rates because the risk of default - a borrower not paying back their loan - is so high. And they make the argument that if they didn't lend money to these people, no one else would.  All of these arguments have some merit, and if we want to fight predatory lending, we need to learn to make counter-arguments. This is where our newly learned mathematical skills come into play.    If people are willing to pay...  The first argument for payday lending says, basically, that if people are willing to pay for a payday loan, then it should be legal to offer them. This is a free market argument - essentially saying that if the fees were too much, the market wouldn't support them.  There is definitely something to this argument - in Texas, for example, in 2021, there is no cap on the interest that can be charged for a payday loan, but as we saw above, the average rate is 664%. This is essentially letting the market choose the rate - lenders have stopped at this point because no one will pay rates higher.  The people who borrow loans at these ultra-high interest rates, though, don't do it because they have plenty of money to throw around. They do it because they have no other choice. We can see this by looking at the correlation between the number of payday lenders and where people live.   shows data, taken from the 2012 American Community Survey (part of the Census) on the 20 largest counties in Alabama. For each, we have the number of 522390 establishments (a category which includes payday lenders and related businesses which provide financial services outside of the traditional banking sector), the percentage of the population which is white, the percentage of the population which is Black, and the median household income.      County  Number of Payday Lenders  Percent White  Percent Black  Median Household Income    Baldwin County  16  86.3  8.8  48378    Calhoun County  15  75.6  21.4  39169    Cullman County  6  96.4  1.1  37287    DeKalb County  6  94  0.8  38445    Elmore County  10  75.9  20.9  53328    Etowah County  10  81.3  15  34264    Houston County  14  70.2  26.5  40409    Jefferson County  82  53.2  42.6  43959    Lauderdale County  9  87.2  10  41908    Lee County  14  70.2  22.8  45043    Limestone County  5  80.7  12.5  47999    Madison County  23  69.2  24.5  56839    Marshall County  9  90.6  2.1  36197    Mobile County  51  60.6  35.1  39691    Montgomery County  33  39.6  55.3  41807    Morgan County  9  82.2  11.8  45051    St. Clair County  8  87.7  9.2  51859    Shelby County  15  81.1  11.2  65728    Talladega County  9  64.2  34  31547    Tuscaloosa County  17  67  30.4  41139      We can look at the correlations between these different data sets. For example, the R code below calculates the correlation between the number of payday lenders and the white population of a county, which is -0.68.   This means that there is a negative correlation between the percentage of a county which is white and the number of payday lenders - that is, the more white people live in a county, the fewer payday lenders will you find. Because Alabama is largely a biracial state (with non-white and non-Black minority populations making up a very small percentage of the population), we see a similar (but reversed) correlation between Black population and payday lenders of 0.67 - so more Black people in a county corresponds to more payday lenders. The R code to calculate that correlation is next.   When we see a correlation like this, as we discussed before, we need to remember that it's not proof of a cause - just evidence. One thing we should always be thinking about is the possibility of confounding . Confounding is when another factor we're not thinking about causes a change in our data. For example, here, poverty could be a confounding factor. Because of the deep legacy of racial inequality in the United States, Black people are more likely to live in poverty. Could the correlation between counties with higher Black populations and payday lenders actually be because those counties are poorer? Let's look and see if there is a correlation between median income and the number of payday lenders.   The correlation here is 0.02, extremely close to 0. Remember that a correlation of 0 means that there is no relationship between the two data sets - that when one increases, the other is equally likely to increase or decrease. So median income doesn't predict the number of payday lenders nearly as well as race.  In the exercises, we'll consider another possible confounding factor - population. Is it possible that the counties with larger Black populations just have more people, and thus more payday lenders?    We have to charge those rates, because of the risk!  The second argument made for why payday loans are \"fair\" is that the lenders are taking a large risk by making the loans - so they should be entitled to charge high interest rates. One question here - which we won't focus on - is whether it is fair to charge interest at all, or if our society should have a more effective way of providing capital to those who lack it. Kiva is a non-profit organization that provides loans without interest worldwide, for example. But even working within the existing framework of capitalism, where any money borrowed must be repaid with interest, we can ask the question of what level of interest is fair.  Let's look at how much money payday lenders are making on loans, through the lens of expected value. In 2015, the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) found that 46% of all payday loan borrowers defaulted on their loans within two years . A default on a loan occurs when the lender is unable to meet the terms of the loan. While this doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't pay the loan back (in fact, the CRL found that 66% of those defaulting eventually paid their loans back in full, plus any fees that they would have paid for defaulting, like late fees), it does mean that the lender is losing some money on the investment. The same study found that 20% of loans are charged off within two years, meaning that the lender gives up on collecting the debt. Again, this doesn't mean they lose all of their money, since the loans are then usually sold to a debt collector who tries to collect some or all of the money, but they do lose much of their investment in this case.  Obviously, these situations are very complicated, and there are a lot of possible results, so as we did before, we'll consider a simplified version.  Let's assume that 20% of the time, the lender loses everything (the loan is charged off). 26% of the time (in the other defaults), they get paid back the full value of the loan, plus the interest, plus late fees. In the remaining 54% of cases, the lender pays back the loan in full.  In a 2014 report, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that the median payday loan sequence is repaid after one month . So in our scenario above, there are 3 possibilities - 20% of the time, the lender loses everything; 26% of the time, they get back the loan, plus the interest and late fees; and 54% of the time they get their loan back plus interest.  Let's say someone borrows $300 for one month in California at a 460% interest rate. The late fee for a defaulting lender is $25. How much money should the payday lender expect to make off of them?  First we need to calculate the interest paid, using the simple interest formula: The borrower ends up paying $415 total, or $115 in interest.  Now we can calculate expected value. We take each probability and multiply it times the amount that the lender earns (or a negative value, if they lose money). Then we add them up. On average, the lender earns $38.50 on the $300 loan.  Of course, many borrowers end up renewing their loans for much more than a month. Unlike a borrower who pays back their loan quickly, who may just have a temporary emergency need for money, these borrowers struggle to ever pay back their loan, racking up more fees each time they renew the loan.  What if we look at the exact same scenario, but the borrower borrows the money for a year? Then they will pay back a total of The borrower ends up paying $1,680 total, so $1,380 in interest. If they default on the loan, they also end up paying late fee (possibly more than one, but let's assume just one). We can calculate the expected value for the payday lender: For every borrower that pays their loan back after a year of fees, on average, the lender can expect to earn $1050.50! This illustrates the fundamental mechanic of payday lending - the lenders make more money if they lend to borrowers who can just barely afford to pay the loan back. They have a vested interest in lending to people who are struggling to get by instead of those who are dealing with an unexpected emergency.    If we don't lend to them, who will?  This point, of all those made, is the most salient. Payday lenders exist because for many people with poor credit, there are no other options. If a borrower has something of value to pawn, they could use a pawn broker - but for people struggling to get by, things of value may be too precious to pawn (the computer that a student uses for school; heirloom jewelry; the car used to get to work).  However, as compelling as this argument might be, it turns out to be false. Many states have banned payday lending, usually by setting a cap of 36% on annual interest rates. While this cap may seem high when compared to interest rates on credit cards and other types of loans, it is generally low enough to make payday lending untenable. In 2017, the Center for Responsible Lending studied states which have passed these kinds of bans, and found that banning payday loans did not significantly impact borrowers' access to credit . Borrowers who would otherwise have used a payday loan, had they been legal, turned to products such as lines of credit, installment loans, loans from religious institutions, and payment plans with creditors. Because of the high interest rates and predatory fees, researchers found that taking out payday loans actually made consumers more likely to have negative financial outcomes, like declaring bankruptcy.  In the absence of payday lenders, financial institutions like credit unions can fill the gap. Many credit unions, which are non-profits, offer payday alternative loans to their members. These loans function much like payday loans, but with interest rates that are much more reasonable. Removing bad actors like payday lenders creates more space for financial services like these to be successul in our communities.    What Can We Do?  The payday lending industry has deep pockets and strong connections to maany of the powerful people in this country.   "

  "body": "  A payday lender charges an annual percentage rate of 350% (simple interest). If you borrow $200 for two weeks, how much will you have to pay back? How much will you have to pay back if you renew the loan three times (for a total of 8 weeks)?    The most common way that states have \"banned\" payday loans is by prohibiting annual percentage rates above a certain level, usually 36%. Consider a payday loan of $400, where the loan is due back plus a payment of $40 in two weeks. How much money would you save if the loan charged an annual percentage rate of 36% (simple interest) instead? Remember that your time needs to be converted to years!    You borrow $500 from a payday lender for 2 weeks, and they charge you a fee of $50 when you repay the loan. What is the equivalent annual percentage rate? How much interest would you have paid if you borrowed the money on a credit card which charged 18% instead?    You borrow $100 from a payday lender for 2 weeks, and they charge you a fee of $20 every two weeks until you pay off the loan. Assume that it takes you 3 months before you can pay off the loan. How much do you end up paying total? What is the equivalent annual percentage rate?    You borrow $100 from a payday lender for 2 weeks, and they charge you a fee of $20 every two weeks until you pay off the loan. Assume that it takes you 3 months before you can pay off the loan. How much money would you save if the loan charged 36% (APR) simple interest instead?    You borrow $500 and pay it back after 2 months. Calculate how much you would pay total in each of these scenarios. All interest rates are given as Annual Percentage Rates (APR) so be sure to use time in years!  You borrow the money from a friend who charges you 7% simple interest.  You put the purchase on a credit card that charges 21% compounded daily.  You put the purchase on a credit card that charges 21% compounded daily, plus a late fee of $10 for not paying the debt off after the first month.  You borrow the money from a payday lender that charges you a fee of $10 each week that you don't repay the loan.    How do the amounts compare in each situation? Explain why someone might choose to use a payday loan instead of a credit card or a personal loan from a friend.    The map in gives the payday lending rates in US states where predatory lending is still legal. Compute the total amount you would pay on a payday loan of $400 in Nevada, Indiana, and Ohio, if you paid it off after 6 months. How different are the amounts? Does the interest rate make a big difference in how much you pay?    Working as a class, use the map in to calculate the total amount you would pay on a payday loan of $400 in every state. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, the average payday borrower flips the loan 8 times, so we will use 18 weeks (the initial 2 weeks plus 8 more 2 week periods) for the borrowing time. Calculate the amount that the borrower would pay, using simple interest and the APR rates from to find how much the typical borrower would pay on the loan in each state where payday lending is still allowed.    A payday lender loans you $400, with a fee of $60 due when you pay the loan back in two weeks. If the lender believes there is a 5% chance that you will not pay back the loan at all, what is the expected value for the lender?    A payday lender loans you $300, with a fee of $35 due when you pay the loan back in two weeks. If the lender believes that there is a 2% chance that you will not pay back the loan at all, what is the expected value for the lender?    A payday lender charges $50 to loan you $400 for two weeks. Calculate the expected value for the lender if  There is a 2% chance you do not repay the loan at the end of two weeks.  There is a 5% chance you do not repay the loan at the end of two weeks.  There is a 10% chance you do not repay the loan at the end of two weeks.  There is a 15% chance you do not repay the loan at the end of two weeks.  Explain how lenders could use this information to decide if they should loan to a particular client.      According to the CFPB , 20% of the borrowers of payday loans eventually default. However, many of these borrowers make one or more payments before they default. Consider a $300 payday loan which charges a $40 fee every two weeks.  If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults without making any payments and an 80% chance that they repay the loan after two weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?  If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults after making one payment and an 80% chance that the borrower repays the loan after 4 weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?  If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults after making two payments and an 80% chance that the borrower repays the loan after 6 weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?  Explain how payday lenders could use this calculation to make money even when lenders have a high chance of default.  People generally default on loans because they are in severe financial distress. Research the consequences of defaulting on a loan - what effect can it have on a person's ability to borrow money, open bank accounts, get a job, or obtain housing? How long can these effects last?  Discuss the ethical ramifications of loaning money to someone with such a high likelihood of default, given the severe negative consequences of a default.      A payday lender loans you $300. Every two weeks that you do not pay off the loan, you own the lender $30. The lender believes there is a 10% chance that you will pay the loan off after two weeks, a 20% chance that you will pay the loan off after 4 weeks, a 30% chance you will pay the loan off after 6 weeks, a 30% chance that you will pay the loan off after 8 weeks, and a 10% chance that you will go 8 weeks and stop making payments ( defaulting on the loan). Complete the table below by computing how much money the lender makes in each scenario, and the chance of them making that much money. Remember to use a negative number if they lose money.    Event  Probability  Amount Lender Makes    Pays off in 2 weeks        Pays off in 4 weeks        Pays off in 6 weeks        Pays off in 8 weeks        Defaults after 8 weeks        Use your table to compute the expected value for the lender.    A lender in North Dakota loans you $400. Use the data in to determine how much you would pay if you paid the loan off after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, or 8 weeks. The table below gives the probabilities that the lender believes you will pay off the loan after a certain amount of time, or that you will default after 8 weeks of payments:    Event  Probability  Amount Lender Makes    Pays off in 2 weeks  0.05      Pays off in 4 weeks  0.15      Pays off in 6 weeks  0.30      Pays off in 8 weeks  0.20      Defaults after 8 weeks  0.30      Complete the table and use it to calculate the expected value for the lender. What is the expected value for the lender? Should they expect to make money off the loan?    You are applying for a loan from a bank that charges 8% interest, compounded monthly.  If you pay the loan off in one lump sum after 2 years, how much will you owe?  The bank believes, based on your credit score, that there is a 5% chance that you will not pay back the loan (called a default). Using your answer from the previous question, calculate the expected value of the loan for the bank.  Repeat the last problem, but this time assume that there is a 20% chance that you will not pay back the loan. What is the expected value for the bank now?  Repeat the previous question, but this time assume that the bank charges 15% interest. How much money do you owe after 2 years? What is the expected value for the bank if there is a 20% chance that you will not pay back the loan?  Do these calculations justify why the bank charges higher interest rates for some people than others? Explain why you gave your answer.      You borrow $800 from a payday lender to help cover your rent. The payday lender charges you $20 every two weeks until you pay off the loan.  How much do you pay the payday lender total if it takes you 2 years to pay off the loan?  What is the expected value for the lender, if there is a 5% chance that you don't pay the loan back after 2 years?  What is the expected value for the lender if there is a 20% chance that you don't pay the loan back after 2 years?  Explain why the lender can expect to make money on this loan, no matter how likely you are not to pay it back, as long as there is some chance that you will pay it back.      The file Alabama_Payday.csv contains the data we looked at in , but with two more columns - the population of each county and the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people in each county. In the chapter, we discussed the possibility that our correlation between payday lenders and larger Black populations might actually be a correlation between larger counties and larger Black populations, since we would expect larger counties to have more payday lenders. Computing a figure per 100,000 people in an area is a common way to compare statistics in areas of differing populations.  Calculate the correlation to see if larger counties do have more payday lenders. Then calculate the correlation between the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people and the percentage of each race in that county to see if there is still a correlation after we adjust for population. You can use the code window below, a spreadsheet program, or your calculator.     The file county-lender-data.csv contains data similar to what we looked at in the previous problem, but for every county in the United States of America (all data is from the 2021 County Business Patterns (CBP) and 2021 American Community Survey (ACS) of the US Census ). This file contains:  County Name  State Name  The number of payday lenders or similar businesses (more accurately, these are businesses classified as NAICS code 522390 , which includes check-cashing and money-wiring services, in addition to payday lending) in that county.  The population of the county.  The percentage of the county which is white.  The percentage of the county which is Black.  The percentage of the county who identify as Hispanic (note that as this is a cultural identity, individuals who identify as Hispanic can be white, Black, or neither).  The median household income in the county.  The percentage of people in the county over age 18 who have a high school diploma (or equivalent) or higher degree.  The number of payday lenders (NAICS code 522390) per 100,000 people in each county.    Choose a state to examine. Using the code window below, a calculator, or a spreadsheet program, calculate the correlation between the number of payday lenders and population, percentage white, percentage Black, percentage Hispanic, median income, and percentage of people with a high school diploma or equivalent. Which of these correlations are strongest for your state? Which are weakest? Explain what this tells you about where payday lenders are located.  Now repeat the exercise above, but use the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people. Which correlations are strongest for your state? Which are weakest? Explain what this tells you about where payday lenders are located. Why is this more useful than what you uncovered above?     The correlation values can be very different for different states. Repeat the work you did in , using the data from county-lender-data.csv and looking at the correlations between each variable and the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people, for the states of Missouri and New York. What is different about the correlations for these two states? Look at the data and do your own research on these two states - what might explain these very different correlations?    Working as a class, divide up the states and territories given in the file county-lender-data.csv . Calculate the correlations between each variable (percent white, percent Black, percent Hispanic, median income, percentage with high school diploma or higher) and the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people. Create a table as a class, using a shared spreadsheet or other document, with all of the correlations. What is the strongest correlation for each state? What is the weakest correlation? What patterns do you see in the correlations? Discuss the results as a class.    Using your results from , , and your own research, prepare a class letter to submit to your local government (city, county, or state) about payday lending. You should discuss how the calculations can help government officials to regulate payday lenders and understand the effect of these predatory lenders on communities.

  "title": "Understanding the Issue",
  "body": " Understanding the Issue   Why is good health important?  Have you ever gotten sick and thought to yourself “I feel so bad that I can’t do anything. I have been taking my good health for granted!”  Dealing with health issues is a burden. Not only can they prevent us from being able to do the things that we love to do - they can make it harder to do the things we need to do to survive. Healthcare can be expensive and even harder to afford if our health issues prevent us from working. To take an extreme example, if you are injured in a way that prevents you from doing your job, you may lose both your job and have to pay a hefty sum for treatment. Without some kind of safety net, your situation can quickly become life or death.  So, as a society, we have developed mechanisms that serve as safety nets for us when we get sick or injured. In the modern age, the most fundamental of these is health insurance. We pay a monthly fee to an insurance organization, even if we are in good health. These fees are aggregated and distributed to those of us who need them: When we need to pay for healthcare, money is taken from this pot to help financially support our care.    Access to healthcare  Different countries take different approaches to maintaining the health of their citizens. Before modern times, governments did not guarantee their citizens any form of health insurance. Instead, large family units, religious institutions, and\/or community organizations played the role of the health insurance company, coming together to financially support community members when they got sick. Today, the government usually plays a role in making sure all of its citizens have access to health insurance. In some countries around the world such as Canada, Iceland, Kuwait, and South Korea (full list at ), all citizens are guaranteed affordable access to health care by the government through a system called universal health care, usually financed by taxpayers.  In the United States, the system is more complicated. What seems to be considered the ideal situation is to have your employer pay for your health insurance by deducting a certain amount from your paycheck each month. At the time of writing, the Affordable Care Act gives unemployed citizens access to health insurance, but they have to enroll themselves at https:\/\/healthcare.gov and must find a way to pay for the insurance themselves or use assistance programs. How much they pay depends on their living situation and many other factors .  It’s worth noting that even with these programs, many Americans remain uninsured. If you’re uninsured and have a health crisis, your only option is the emergency room (ER). The ER provides care without proof of insurance but is expensive, and this option can quickly result in rapidly accruing medical debt.  In fact, data shows that the U.S. has among the poorest health outcomes in the world as compared to other developed nations. Among Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, we spend the most on our healthcare system, and yet have the lowest life expectancy, highest number of hospitalizations from preventable causes, and highest rate of avoidable deaths (see e.g. ).  There is something wrong with our current system, and the government is not doing enough to maintain the health of our citizens. Everyone deserves to have their basic medical needs met, so why is the United States faring so poorly, and what can we do?    Social determinants of health  Scholars argue that the problem lies in the connection between poverty and poor health outcomes. Whether or not you have insurance, poverty contributes both to lack of access to healthcare, and poor health in the first place. To give you some examples, imagine the following scenarios:   You may not be able to afford transportation to the doctor’s office.  You may not have received adequate health education resulting in poor health literacy.  You may only be able to afford foods which do not provide adequate nutrition, leading to worse health outcomes.  You may have been forced into a living situation contributing to poor health, such as an apartment with poor air quality due to a mold problem.  You may be forced to live in a neighborhood where drugs and\/or crime are prevalent.  Your immigration status may limit your ability to work or receive healthcare.   Social determinants of health refer to those sociodemographic factors which correlate positively or negatively (see ) with poor health outcomes. As you might imagine, income is a one of these. Others include employment status, highest degree of education, disability status, quality of affordable housing, etc.  The documentary Unnatural Causes: Place Matters gives concrete examples which show how an individual living in poverty can be stuck in a living situation adversely affecting their health. A stressful living situation can complicate issues such as heart problems, which may make it hard or impossible to work, which in turn makes it impossible to improve your living situation. Health issues and poverty can compound one another in a sinister feedback loop .  In other words, there is a vicious cycle: Living in poverty can make you sick, and being sick can keep you poor or make you poorer.    The role of nonprofits  Not-for-profit free health clinics have cropped up across the country to improve Americans’ access to healthcare. Since poverty is the root cause, we can’t expect these clinics to be a complete solution, but they do offer an important service to uninsured and\/or low-income residents of underserved communities, providing basic health services such as check-ups, medication, lab work, basic dental and vision exams, counseling, and referrals to specialists.  One issue some clinics face is that the patients who most need their services are not able to easily get to their clinic. Perhaps they do not have a car, perhaps they have a very tight schedule, or perhaps they have mobility challenges. Thus, nonprofits may strategically deploy mobile clinics within the geographical region they are able to serve. Such a clinic might operate out of an RV and offer a limited subset of clinical services including basic health check-ups, or COVID-19\/flu vaccinations.  Since their monetary and human resources are limited, the health clinic must choose wisely in its deployment of the mobile units. How can they effectively choose where to concentrate their efforts? We will see in this module how mathematics can help these nonprofits use sociodemographic and geographic data to make informed decisions about resource allocation.   "

  "title": "Cui Bono - Who Benefits?",
  "body": " Cui Bono - Who Benefits?  The previous section described the connection between poverty and health outcomes. But why do we have such a problem with poverty in the United States in the first place, and who benefits from the status quo being the way that it is?  If we want to understand this, we need to take a slight digression and explore the connection between geography and race. The unfortunate truth is a history of systemic racism.   Redlining, disinvestment, and race and geography as social determinants of health  We gave some examples of social determinants of health in the previous section. Yet another pair of social determinants of health is your address and your race. Let’s dig a bit deeper into why this is.  Not all neighborhoods are created equally. In the 1930s, the U.S. government established standards for providing home loans to Americans after commissioning maps categorizing neighborhoods by desirability for lending. In a racist process known as redlining, the most \"undesirable\" neighborhoods, outlined in red, tended to be older urban neighborhoods, collectively including a majority of the African American households in the country .  In the following decades, historians theorize that these maps were used to deny loans to African Americans, effectively trapping them in these same neighborhoods . African Americans received less than 2 percent of all federally-insured home loans from 1945 to 1959 . Meanwhile, many whites moved out of these neighborhoods in the 1950s and 60s in a process known as white flight . They were incentivized in part by their ability to actually obtain home loans in newer affluent suburbs, as well as other racist practices such as blockbusting , where developers convinced white homeowners to sell their homes at a discount in part through fearmongering about racial minorities in their communities .  Thus began a cycle of disinvestment in Black communities, for the benefit of a powerful few, which continues today. These cycles of poverty exist elsewhere, too, and might follow this formula:   A neighborhood of racially minoritized Americans, usually Black or Latinx, is perceived to be undesirable by those with influence.  Those who can afford it distance themselves from that community and move to newer, affluent communities.  There is little incentive to invest in the original community. Rather, those in power often lobby for infrastructure improvements in the affluent communities where their constituents live. This might be attributed in part to gerrymandering ( ), suppression of voting rights, misinformation ( ), and\/or prioritization of corporate interests.  Disinvestment in the disenfranchised community causes quality of life to decrease. The quality of housing, education, public transportation, infrastructure, social services, access to healthcare, etc., declines due to lack of investment. Crime may increase, opportunities diminish, and health outcomes worsen. Perception of the community may worsen as well, creating a feedback loop.  Repeat.     Whataboutism  Depending on your background, you may have a kneejerk negative reaction to the narrative above that is worth acknowledging and briefly addressing. In particular, a white person who grew up poor might read the section above and ask \"What about my story?\"  It is true that such individuals' stories should be told, and that their perspectives are valuable. There are of course other issues causing suffering besides systemic racism; it just so happens that the phenomenon is a particularly well-documented and widespread manifestation of the brokenness of many deeply ingrained systems. Shedding light on and fixing this brokenness is in fact likely to improve the system for all of us.   The tendency to get stuck comparing our struggles and degrees of suffering with one another is a form of whataboutism . Rather than leading to productive change, this way of thinking only leads to gridlock. In fact, those in power who benefit when the status quo is maintained use whataboutism in their rhetoric to pit us against one another while keeping us from uniting against the root causes of our unhappiness . This idea is closely related to the concept of false consciousness  .  In any case, both your address and your race can negatively affect your health, and those in power have so far not been willing and able to adequately address the root of the inequality. It appears that a true solution to the problem of poor health outcomes in the United States would involve a confrontation of systemic racism. This is a monumental task, but a worthy one if we believe that everyone deserves to have their basic medical needs met.  Let’s now explore how free health clinics can function better within the current state of affairs.   "

  "title": "The Big Problem: Optimizing the Placement of Mobile Health Clinics",
  "body": " The Big Problem: Optimizing the Placement of Mobile Health Clinics   How can nonprofits take multiple social determinants of health into account in order to create accurate measures of medical need in the communities they serve? How many possibilities do they need to consider when deciding where to place mobile clinics? How might the number of possibilities thus depend on the types of resources available? How could geographical considerations (such as not wanting to have multiple clinic locations too close together) be taken into account?   Let’s imagine that a nonprofit such as Open Arms Free Clinic (OAFC) has tasked us with finding the best locations in a community for their mobile clinic. To get an idea of the size of the problem to be solved, we may first want to compute the number of possibilities of where we might place the clinics, under a few different scenarios or assumptions. This motivates the multiplication and division rules for counting, which leads to the idea of permutations and combinations. In the next section, we will consider some more complex scenarios motivating the counting techniques of the addition and subtraction rules.  Next we need to quantify medical need. We will introduce a basic way of combining several variables of interest in a single model called a parametric linear model. In doing so, we will establish a measure of medical need based on social determinants of health, and use it to identify the areas of greatest need.  Perhaps the solution we obtain in the previous step is inadequate because it suggests mobile clinic placements that are clustered too closely together. We will describe how we can account for this by introducing some additional assumptions that will help us ensure that we are spreading out our resources. In the process, we will learn about discrete optimization.  Finally, we will consider one additional variable closely related to poverty, and put everything together. A similar solution to this problem was presented to OAFC in Spring of 2022 by actual students at Beloit College.  "

  "body": " The Product and Division Rules; Permutations and Combinations  Open Arms Free Clinic (OAFC) in Elkhorn, Wisconsin serves uninsured residents living below of the poverty line in Walworth County, Wisconsin. This clinic and the geographical area they serve will be a running example for us.   The map below shows the municipalities in Walworth County. Later, we will remove the municipality of Burlington City from our analysis since it barely overlaps the county and there was no data for it available for any of the variables we will consider.   Walworth County, WI.   A map of the municipalities in Walworth County, WI. Image Description .    The product rule and permutations  Consider the following motivating example.    Let's imagine that OAFC intends to open three mobile health clinics in separate municipalities within Walworth County, each one staffed by a different volunteer. How many different ways could they do this?    Let's label the clinics , , and according to the volunteer staffing them, and imagine placing the clinics in that order. For clinic , we have municipalities to choose from. For clinic , we have choices since we already used one. Thus there are ways of placing clinic , and then clinic . Then, there are choices for the placement of clinic (since we already used two). Thus there are ways of placing the clinics.    This example illustrates a counting principle called the product rule :   Product rule  Suppose that a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of tasks. The first task can be done in ways, the second task can be done in ways after doing the first task, the third task can be done in ways after doing the first two tasks, and in general the task can be done in ways after doing all the tasks preceding it. Then there are   ways to do the procedure.   The form that the product rule takes in comes up so often that it has its own notation, the factorial .   Factorials  For a positive integer , we write to stand for the product of the numbers through . That is, . In order to make common formulas involving factorials work in edge cases, we also define .     Find for .    by convention.  .  .  .  .  .    A permutation is a way of creating a sequence of labeled objects from some larger collection when replacement is not allowed. The most common formula for counting permutations uses factorials.   Permutations  Suppose and are nonnegative integers with . Then the number of ways to place labeled objects in sequence from a larger collection of objects is . We call these ways permutations and write this number as , that is, .   Another notation which is commonly used in place of is .    Let's recall in which OAFC intended to open three mobile clinics in separate municipalities within Walworth County, each one staffed by a different volunteer. We saw that the number of ways to do this was . Explain this answer in terms of permutations.    We can think of the municipalities as a collection of objects ( ) and note that a sequence of three municipalities (a permutation) exactly corresponds to a way of staffing three clinic locations. Thus we can imagine the municipalities as a large collection of objects from which we must count the number of permutations of size , or . By the formula above, , the same as our answer. Note the large amount of cancellation in the numerator and denominator arising from the factorial!      The division rule and combinations  Next, consider the following variant of :    Suppose now that OAFC is interested only in the possible clinic locations, and is not concerned with staffing at the moment. In other words, they simply intend to open three mobile health clinics in separate municipalities within Walworth County. How many different ways could they do this?    Let's again label the clinics , , and . As in , there are ways of placing the clinics with their labels. What has changed in the current example? In short, we no longer care about the labels of the clinics. As in , a placement in the same municipalities which only switches the labels on clinics and should be considered equivalent to the original. The question becomes \"How many placements are equivalent to a given placement?\" And the answer to this is , since this number represents the number of ways we can label the clinics for this specific choice of municipalities. Now, since each of the clinic placements has other equivalent placements, we can find the answer to our question by dividing by . In other words, there are ways of placing the clinics in this way.   Two equivalent placements.      Two equivalent clinic placements. Image Description .      This example illustrates a counting principle called the division rule :   Division rule  Suppose that there are ways of completing a procedure, but that those ways are not unique in the sense that each of the them is equivalent to others including itself. Then the task can be done in unique ways.   A combination is a way of choosing a subset of labeled objects from some larger collection when replacement is not allowed. The formula for the number of combinations comes from the division rule.   Combinations  Suppose and are nonnegative integers with . Then the number of ways to choose labeled objects in sequence from a larger collection of objects is . We call these ways combinations and write this number as , that is, .   Another notation which is commonly used in place of is . Some authors also write . The numbers that arise in this way are sometimes called binomial coefficients . There is a good reason for this which you may enjoy exploring . Some of the many beautiful patterns that can be seen in these numbers are explored in the exercises.    Let's recall in which OAFC intended to open three mobile clinics in separate municipalities within Walworth County. We saw that the number of ways to do this was . Explain this answer in terms of combinations.

Let's imagine that OAFC intends to open at most three (and at least one) mobile health clinics in separate municipalities within Walworth County. How many different ways could they do this?    First, note that order does not matter in choosing clinic locations, as in , so combinations will probably be involved. Next, the words at most are crucial, and suggest a way of breaking up our problem. Assuming that we will place at least one clinic, we can either place one, or two, or three clinic locations in the municipalities. There is no overlap in these different categories (since, for example, a way of placing three clinics will necessarily be distinct from a way of placing two clinics). Thus, we can simply count the number of ways to place one, two, or three clinics, and then add them up! As in , there are ways of placing three clinics. Similarly, there are ways of placing four clinics, and ways of placing one clinic. Thus there are a total of ways.    illustrates the addition rule :   Addition rule  Suppose that a procedure may be done in either ways or ways, and that there is no overlap between the ways. Then there are ways of completing the procedure.  More generally, if there are types of ways of completing a procedure, with ways of completing the procedure using the type of way, and no overlap between any of the types, then there are ways of completing the procedure.

How many different municipalities must be removed from consideration? If OAFC intends to place 2 clinics in separate remaining municipalities, how many possibilities for clinic placements are there?    Note that there are exactly three municipalities which are both northernmost and easternmost (those being Mukwonago village, East Troy town, and East Troy village).

  "title": "Parametric Linear Models",
  "body": " Parametric Linear Models  In order to help OAFC decide on the best place for mobile health clinics within Walworth county, we will need to create a model of medical need. How exactly we do this will depend on many different factors, and there is no single right way to do it. One way of approaching the problem is to start by making some simplifying assumptions for our model. For the moment, me might make the following assumptions:   We will place three mobile clinics in three separate municipalities around the county. At the moment, we will not worry about exactly where the clinics are placed within each municipality.  For each municipality, we will compute a value between and which represents the medical need within that municipality as a percentage. This value will take into account several different variables which are strategically chosen, and whose values come from some trusted data set.  For each variable, we will use percentages of residents or households rather than population. This will ensure that our solution does not simply target the most populous areas.  We will choose to place our clinics in the three municipalities having the three highest measures of need.    What variables are important in determining medical need? To simplify things, let's start by considering two of them: The percentage of working individuals who do not have a car (which we call ), and the percentage of individuals who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino (which we call ). The choice of variable is justified by the fact that OAFC is particularly interested in serving individuals in their mobile clinic who cannot make it to the existing clinic in Elkhorn. It stands to reason that individuals without a car would struggle to get to the clinic in an area with limited public transportation. On the other hand, the choice of variable is partially justified by the systemic issues mentioned in . Indeed, individuals in this category are more likely to be noncitizens or undocumented than those in other minority categories, and data shows that these populations are more likely to be uninsured . Finally, the data below shows that this category is the largert minority category, by far, in the county.   Race\/ethnic categories in Walworth County, WI .    Race\/ethnic category  Percentage    White alone  83.70%    Black or African American alone  1%    American Indian and Alaska Native alone  0.10%    Asian alone  0.70%    Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone  0%    Some other race alone  0.60%    Two or more races  2.30%    Hispanic or Latino  11.60%     How can we combine these two variables to create a single model of medical need? The simplest way to do so is by choosing a weight  between and and creating a new variable defined as follows: The number represents the fraction of the significance we place on the variable . When , all weight goes into variable , and when , all weight goes into variable . Equal weight is placed on the two variables when . The model is flexible in that we can allow the client to choose a value of based on their own judgement of the relative importance of the variables. We will default to for simplicity. The table below shows the values of , and for each municipality in the county when .   Vehicle availability and Hispanic\/Latino self-identification by municipality , .

Rather than placing a clinic within both Delavan city and Delavan town, it would make more sense to serve the need in Delavan town and Delavan city with a single clinic in Delavan city. This would free OAFC up to place another clinic somewhere else in the county.   Parametric linear model   Three municipalities of highest need according to parametric linear model. The darker the color, the higher the need. Image Description .   Continuing along this line of reasoning, it seems to make sense to assume that each mobile clinic will have a certain radius of effective coverage. Areas within this radius can then be assumed to have all of their need met, or perhaps some fraction of their need met proportional to how far they are from the nearby clinic. For simplicity, let's assume that nearby municipalities will have all of their need met.  What will we mean by \"nearby\" municipalities? Again, we have some choice here. For simplicity, let's use the centroid of each municipality as a stand-in for where each clinic will be placed, and to measure how close other municipalities are to it. The centroid of a 2-dimensional shape can be defined using calculus, and we won't spend time on it here. For our purposes, suffice it to say that the centroid of a shape is like a center of mass: If we were to laser-cut a piece of sheet metal in the shape of Delavan city, its centroid would be the point upon which it would balance perfectly on a finger. shows each municipality in the county along with its centroid.   Municipalities with centroids.   Municipalities in Walworth county with centroids. Image Description .   With this additional assumption, one way to adjust our model is as follows:   As before, our goal will be to place three mobile clinics in three separate municipalities around the county. We will assume that each mobile clinic is placed at the centroid of a municipality.  As before, we will compute a value between and which represents the medical need within that municipality as a percentage, taking into account several strategically-chosen variables. For now, we will use the parametric linear model from the previous section.  We will choose (or allow OAFC to choose) a parameter which represents the effective service radius of the mobile clinics. For a given choice of placement of the three clinics, we will compute the need met by adding up all need values corresponding to municipalities whose centroids fall within the service radius of one or more of the mobile clinics.  We will choose to place our clinics according to the placement which gives the greatest amount of need met.   At this point, we have a very nice example of a discrete optimization problem. In fact, this specific type of problem is known as the maximal covering location problem   .   Discrete optimization  Discrete optimization is a broad area of study at the intersection of applied math and computer science. The goal is usually to minimize or maximize a function called an objective function . The most challenging problems in discrete optimization involve finding the maximum or minimum of the objective function among a large, but finite, set of possibilities. Often, the number of possibilities is so large that they cannot all be tested in a reasonable amount of time, and clever algorithms must be used to limit the number of possibilities to test, or to compute an approximate solution.   These days, a very popular application of discrete optimization is artificial intelligence. The problem of (approximately) minimizing or maximizing an objective function is fundamental to the success of machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a carefully-chosen objective function at the heart of language models such as ChatGPT .  Additionally, the reason that we care so much about counting the number of possibilities for the problem at hand (using permutations, combinations, etc) is that the size of the domain of the objective function (the number of possibilities to be considered) must be analyzed to estimate the amount of computing resources needed to solve the problem.  In our model, the objective function is the measure of need mentioned in the third step. The set of all possible clinic placements is the total number of possibilities to test. We certainly would not want to do this by hand, but a computer can do it relatively quickly. However, if there were ten times as many municipalities, or even if we were placing twice as many clinics, a clever algorithm may be needed to enable the computer to find a solution (or approximate solution) in a reasonable amount of time. Because the time taken by the computer corresponds closely to the number of possibilities to consider, computer scientists rely heavily on the basic counting principles in sections and when they come up with and analyze these algorithms.  The figure below shows a possible solution which was found by a computer, for a value of meters. When the clinics are placed at the three locations of Whitewater city, Delavan city, and Fontana-on-Geneva Lake village, this solution assumes that need is met in all municipalities whose centroids lie within meters of one of the mobile clinics. Those municipalities are the ones whose centroids fall inside one of the green disks. In this case, we cover the need from Delavan city, Delavan town, Fontana-on-Geneva Lake village, Walworth village, Walworth town, Whitewater city, Whitewater town, and Williams Bay village. Adding up their percentages of need from , we see that this optimal solution covers of the need in the county. As we had hoped, this solution uses the proximity of Delavan city and Delavan town to increase the amount of need covered.    MCLP.   Placement of three clinics maximizing coverage.

  "body": " Solving for Change  In this section, we will consider one additional variable and then demonstrate one possible solution which puts everything together. The solution presented here is similar to a solution presented to OAFC by Beloit College students in Spring of 2022.  Perhaps the most important variable we have not yet considered is the percentage of uninsured residents at or below of the federal poverty line (FPL). We have seen the connection between health and poverty, and in fact this is the population that OAFC serves by law. We have saved this analysis for last because it will take some additional mathematical reasoning to estimate based on the data available.  The federal poverty line is determined based on household size, as shown in the table below.   Federal poverty guidelines as of 2021 .    Household size  FPL  2*FPL    1  $12,880  $25,760    2  $17,420  $34,840    3  $21,960  $43,920    4  $26,500  $53,000    5  $31,040  $62,080    6  $35,580  $71,160    7  $40,120  $80,240    8  $44,660  $89,320     Note that the poverty line increases by for each additional member of the household, and of the poverty line increases by per person. This suggests a linear relationship between the number of people per household (call this ), and the value of FPL (call this ). We know that the equation of a line takes the form . Plugging in and any point on the line (say and ) allows us to find . Indeed, has the solution . Thus we have an equation for the value of FPL based on household size: .  We can combine this data with data from the American Community Survey at census.gov to estimate what value \" of the federal poverty line\" should take based on the average household size in each municipality.

So, we will have to estimate.  How should the estimation work? We will have to make an assumption about the percentage of households that fall below the thresholds calculated in . One of the simplest things we could do is to assume that the distribution of incomes is uniform within each income bracket. Under that assumption, and based on the fact that all values lie between and , we can estimate the percentage of uninsured households lying below FPL as follows:  Let's continue to call the variable representing of the FPL, . Let's call the variable representing the percentage of uninsured households making under , and the percentage of uninsured households making betwen and , . Since , we can estimate the percentage of uninsured households under FPL, which we can call , by adding to a certain fraction of . That fraction of , which we can call , should be how \"far\" is along the way from to . If , then should be , and if , then should be . Right in the middle, when , we should have . In fact, there is another linear relationship here:  Now that we have , the formula for is simply . Computing this for all municipalities gives the table below.   Estimated percentage of households which are uninsured and under FPL using data from .

We'll use three variables to create a parametric linear model of medical need, suppose that each clinic serves an effective coverage radius of meters, and choose a placement which maximize the total amount of need met.  Let's take the variables (the normalized percentage of working individuals who do not have a car) and (the normalized percentage of individuals who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino) from , and the variable which estimates the normalized percentage of households which are uninsured and at or below FPL. We'll combine all of three of these into a parametric linear model where , , and are each weighted at (in practice, we would give OAFC the freedom to adjust these weights - for instance, they may decide that should be given more weight). This gives the table below.   Final model of medical need.

We will choose one of them which maximizes the total need covered.  The figure below shows an optimal solution which was found by a computer. This solution involves placing the clinics at the three locations of Whitewater city, Delavan city, and Bloomfield village. The municipalities covered by this placement (those whose centroids fall within one of the green disks) are Bloomfield village, Bloomfield town, Fontana-on-Geneva Lake village, Walworth village, Walworth town, Whitewater city, Whitewater town, and Williams Bay village. Adding up their percentages of need from table , we see that this optimal solution covers of the need in the county.    MCLP2.   Placement of three clinics maximizing coverage. Image Description .

In 2016 the Racial Identity and Profiling Act (RIPA) was passed, which enabled the widespread collection of racial identity in police interactions . Before RIPA, the only cities in California that were required to collect data on the race of citizens involved in police stops were cities whose police forces were under consent decrees- meaning that the federal government had previously found widespread misconduct and mandated that the police force collect that data.  RIPA formed an advisory board comprised of community stakeholders and academic researchers. Each year the board analyzes stop data and releases reports on disparities in policing, which are then used by communities around the state to advocate for changes in both funding and accountability measures for police. As a result of the data, cities like Berkeley, Oakland, San Diego, and Los Angeles have started taking steps towards significant changes to police practices.  Note: Although race is regarded as a social construct by scientists from a wide variety of backgrounds , we acknowledge the very real racialized oppression that many groups experience in the United States. The use of race as a variable in this data is borne out of the necessity of shedding light on this oppression. In some cases police report the race of the person they stop, and in some cases it is also self-reported, which can lead to some uncertainty.  "

  "body": " Understanding data   We have two large data sets, adapted from the Stanford Open Policing Project , giving information on vehicular stops in Hartford, CT and Philadelphia, PA between April 1, 2014 and September 29, 2016. Anyone can access these data sets at . Below are the first two rows from the Philadelphia data set.     date time age race sex searchfrisk contraband arrest    2014-04-01 0:00:00 20 white male FALSE NA FALSE    2014-04-01 0:04:00 33 black male FALSE NA FALSE     We call each row an observational unit or observation . In this case, each observation is one vehicular stop. Each column is called a variable ; here we have 8 variables. First, the date and time of the stop are provided. The next three variables give the age, race, and sex of the driver of the vehicle.  The searchfrisk variable is TRUE if the vehicle was searched or the driver was frisked and FALSE otherwise. If either the vehicle was searched or the driver was frisked, contraband is TRUE if an item was found which was illegal for the driver to possess and FALSE otherwise. If no search or frisk was conducted, contraband cannot be found, so NA (for ``not available'') is written. Finally, the driver is either arrested ( TRUE ) or not arrested ( FALSE ).  The age variable is a numerical variable since the response is a number and it makes sense to perform arithmetic operations on these numbers, such as addition, subtraction, or computing averages. The last five variables are not numerical. Since the responses to these variables fall into different categories, these are called categorical variables. We won't be analyzing the date and time variables, but whether they are considered numerical or categorical depends on the situation.    Summarizing Data   Numerical data  Suppose we are given the following values of a numerical variable:   These values could represent the cost of 18 different taxi rides or 18 students' scores on a quiz or the number of petals on 18 different flowers.  We often want to find the ``center'' or ``middle'' of the values. To compute the mean , we simply add up the values and divide the total by the number of values. In this case, we get   We could say that, on average, each taxi ride cost $5.56, or that the average score on the quiz was 5.56. But sometimes the mean can hide useful information. Suppose we have a class of 10 students and one student has 10 cookies, while the other 9 students have 0 cookies. The mean number of cookies each student has is   So, on average, each student has 1 cookie. But the ``average student'' definitely does not have one cookie--in fact, almost all of the students have 0 cookies!  The median is the middle value once the data is sorted (if there is an even number of values, the median is the mean of the two middle values). For our initial example, we first sort the data:   Since there is an even number of values, we take the mean of the two values in the middle, which are 5 and 6. Hence the median is . Notice that half of the values are less than the median and half are greater.  But what if we want to know more about the data we have than just the mean and median? We can create a histogram . The histogram below provides one way to visualize the data from our initial example.   Histogram showing 3 values in the 0-2 range, 4 in the 2-4 range, 4 in the 4-6 range, 4 in the 6-8 range, and 3 in the 8-10 range.  Example showing a histogram of the given data set.   On the -axis, we've grouped our values into intervals--the leftmost interval goes from 0 to 2, inclusive. The height of the bar in this interval (called the frequency ) is 3, since there are three values ( ) in our data in this interval. The next interval goes from 2 to 4. The interval includes 4 but it does not include 2. The frequency here is 4, because our data included three 3s and one 4. The third interval goes from 4 to 6, and again includes its upper endpoint, 6, but not its lower endpoint, 4. The frequency here is 4, because our data included two 5s and two 6s. The final two intervals are from 6 to 8 (including 8 but not 6) and 8 to 10 (including 10 but not 8). The frequencies in the last two intervals are 4 and 3, respectively.  Let us apply these ideas to the age variable from the Hartford data. Since there 9630 stops recorded in this data set, computing the mean and median by hand would take a long time! Instead, we'll use R , a programming language heavily used in statistics. The functions mean and median give the mean and median of the variable age , while hist creates the histogram. Just hit \"Evaluate R \"\" below each block of code to see the results!       Categorical data  If our data is categorical, none of the previous methods work--we can't take averages or sort the data from least to greatest. Nor can we create intervals and use these to make histograms.  However, there are still a couple things we can do! We can summarize data in a table or make a bar chart .  Consider the sex variable from the Hartford data set. We first make a table in R    From this table, we can see exactly how many of the stopped drivers were male and female. Then, we can use these numbers to determine the proportion of stopped drivers who were female by dividing the number of females (which we just found in the table) by the total number of stops (which we know is 9630). We can get a visual representation of this same data by making a bar chart.      Proportions   Are there more traffic stops in Hartford or Philadelphia?  This question seems easy to answer. We can determine the number of stops in each city between April 1, 2014 and September 29, 2016 using the nrow function.   There were a lot more stops in Philadelphia (678,445) than in Hartford (9630)! In fact, there were   times as many traffic stops in Philadelphia than in Hartford. Does this mean people in Philadelphia are worse drivers or commit more crime? Not necessarily--there are many more people in Philadelphia, so it makes sense that there are more traffic stops. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau, we see that Philadelphia had approximately 1,555,000 people in 2015 and Hartford had 125,000 , . Therefore, there were   times as many people in Philadelphia than in Hartford.  Well, that's interesting. Philadelphia had about 13 times the population, but 70 times the number of traffic stops as Hartford. These data show us that, there were many more traffic stops in Philadelphia than in Hartford in this time frame, even when we control for population . Unfortunately, the data cannot tell us why this is the case. Further research, with the help of experts in policing, history, crime, and a slew of other subjects may help us.    Are Black drivers stopped more often than drivers of other races?  Now let's look at the racial makeup of the stopped drivers in each city. The data here isn't perfect; there are only six possible options for race: asian\/pacific islander , black , hispanic , white , other , and unknown . Many, many people do not fit neatly into one of these categories, but we do what we can with the data we have. We use the table function to get the numbers we want.   Using these tables and the total number of stops in each city, we see that   of the drivers stopped were Black in Hartford and Philadelphia, respectively. We now compare these percentages to 2015 population data from the US Census Bureau. For Hartford, 37.3\\% of the drivers stopped were Black and 38\\% of the population was Black--these numbers seem to indicate that Black drivers were not stopped more frequently than drivers of other races . In Philadelphia, however, 64.2\\% of the drivers stopped were Black while only 42.4\\% of the population was Black . It seems as though Black drivers were disproportionately stopped in Philadelphia during this time. Let's use the data on searches, contraband, and arrests to give us more insight.    "

  "title": "Bayes’ Theorem",
  "body": " Bayes' Theorem   Let's begin with some probability. One way to represent probability is with a number between 1 and 0. A quick way to remember how to calculate some probabilities is   Consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on a six sided die. There are 2 numbers greater than 4 (specifically, 5 and 6), and 6 total possibilities, so the probability of rolling greater than 4 is or approximately 0.33333.  If events and do not influence the probability of each other happening (they are independent events), you can calculate their joint probability by just multiplying their probabilities together. Consider the act of rolling two dice. An example of two independent events are : rolling a 6, and then : rolling an odd number. These events are independent because rolling a 6 with die 1 does not change the probability of rolling an odd number with die 2. Observe that and that since there are three odd numbers on a die. We can then use the formula   and plug in the values we just determined to get   Consider the space of all possible outcomes of rolling two dice, all 36 outcomes. These individual outcome probabilities are recorded in the following table:      1 2 3 4 5 6    1                2                3                4                5                6                 The probability of rolling a six for one of the rolls is represented in the bottom row. The probability of rolling a six and rolling either a 1,3, or 5 are represented by the corresponding columns in the last row, If you add them up, you get a 3\/36 probability.  Now consider the game of craps. One desirable outcome of the game is to roll two dice that sum to 7 or 11. An example of two events are : rolling a number less than 4, and : rolling two dice that sum to 7. Let's say we wanted to know the probability of rolling two dice that sum to 7, given that the first roll is less than 4. In math notation, we write this probability as .  You may remember from a high school algebra course that   and then you can use this formula to determine the probability that the two dice sum to 7 given that the first roll is less than 4.  If we take this formula and multiply both sides by , we see that   But suppose we swap events and . Then notice that   If we solve this for we get   You can also calculate this probability in terms of the probability of event .   But notice that the probability of and is the same as the probability of and , so we know . Plugging in the formulas we just determined for each of these, we see that   Solving for , we obtain Bayes' Theorem:   You might ask, why would you do all of this manipulation? This theorem is now ubiquitous in science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. As we will see in later sections, Bayes' theorem allows you to make predictions and inferences with what seems like incomplete data.    Using Bayes' Theorem to calculate false positives  One consideration that policy makers and public health experts have to take into account when selecting tests for a disease is the false positive and false negative rate. These can be thought of as the probability of testing positive when a person does not have the disease (false positive) and the probability of testing negative when a person actually has the disease.  Let's say we are trying to find the probability of a false negative. This is arguably the scarier scenario from a public health scenario, as we saw with asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 virus. If someone thinks they are negative but are actually positive, they might spread the disease to many others!  Let's say the Umbrella corporation is attempting to test a new rapid COVID test. They start by randomly selecting 100,000 people and administering two tests: their new rapid test and a 100 percent reliable (but slow) Super PCR test. (In reality PCR tests are not 100% effective.)  Note: \"negative\" means tested negative, not actually negative, \"positive\" means tested positive, not actually positive.   In the broader population, the prior belief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is that the positive rate for the disease is 0.1 percent. Therefore, . The manufacturers of the test have taken a random sampling of people and administered the test. Of the 100,000 people, 98,500 people tested negative. Therefore .  Because there are many more non-infected people, and a low negativity rate for the test, the company decides to take the 1,500 people who tested negative using the Super PCR test. All of these people are actually infected, because the other test is 100 pct. accurate. Of these 1,500 people who are actually infected, 1,000 tested positive and 500 tested negative using the rapid test. Therefore, .  We now have everything we need to make the false negative calculation.   This might not seem like a high probability, but consider the implications for a city of 1,000,000 people; that's people walking around the city, spreading disease!   "

  "body": " Solving for Change   Are stopped drivers searched more often if they are Black?  Once a driver is stopped, officers may or may not search them or their vehicle. We can use the table function we've used before in a new way to help us analyze if a driver's race is related to whether or not they are searched.   In Hartford, we already saw that there were 3589 stops of Black drivers. In our new table, we see that 925 of these drivers were searched in some way (look at the TRUE row and black column). The remaining 2664 were not searched. For white drivers, 835 were searched out of a total of 3486 who were stopped. Therefore,   of stopped Black drivers were searched while   of stopped white drivers were searched. Stopped Black drivers seem to be searched at slightly higher rate than stopped white drivers. But perhaps the Black drivers have contraband at a slightly higher rate as well?  We use the table function again, but this time include whether or not contraband was found.   The resulting table is a little more complicated--in fact, you probably see two tables! In the first table, all the entries are 0. The reason for these zeros is that we first consider all drivers who were not searched or frisked. There is no way to find contraband in this case, so the entry in the contraband column is NA --neither TRUE nor FALSE --so all of the entries are 0.  The second table includes all of the drivers who were searched or frisked. Notice that contraband was found for 8 of the 925 searched or frisked Black drivers, or , and for 10 of the 835 searched or frisked white drivers, or . We see that the proportion of white drivers who were stopped or frisked and who possess contraband is slightly higher than that for Black drivers. It is therefore possible that officers are searching Black drivers on less evidence than they are for white drivers.  In summary, in Hartford between April 2014 and September 2016, it seems as though Black drivers were not stopped disproportionately. Stopped Black drivers were searched or frisked at a slightly higher rate than stopped white drivers, and contraband was found on a slightly higher percentage of searched or frisked white drivers than searched or frisked Black drivers. While we cannot make any definitive conclusions based on our analysis, it seems as though there was a small anti-Black bias in vehicular stops and searches, but there did not seem to be large-scale, widespread racial disparities. You should edit the blocks of code above and see what conclusions you can make for the Philadelphia data.    Applying Bayes' Theorem to policing: practice problem  Bayes theorem also gives us a tidy way to analyze probabilities in police interactions. Consider the following scenario: the residents of Fourtown have recently been complaining of age discrimination. They would like to calculate the probability of being searched given that the motorist was over 65.  We know that of the 100 police stops in the last year, 50 ended in searches. Of those 100 stops, 80 were over the age of 65. Thirty of those motorists over 65 years of age were searched. What is the probability of a Fourtown motorist being searched, given that they are over the age of 65?  We can use Bayes' Theorem! If is the event that a motorist is searched and is the event that a motorist is 65 years old or older, we see that     Using Google Colab and Python to analyze a large police stop dataset  To analyze a large police stop dataset, we'll need some more advanced tools.

We'll look at data from the following 10 cities:   Burlington, VT  Camden, NJ  Little Rock, AR  Long Beach, CA  Louisville, KY  Madison, WI  New Orleans, LA  Oakland, CA  Philadelphia, PA  Raleigh, NC   We’re going to look at the probabilities around the race of stopped motorists, and whether they were issued a citation.  Choose two cities to work on and add your name to the list of contributors for those cities in the shared document. You should calculate the following probabilities for each racial group listed in the table:   The probability a stopped motorist is of that race.  The probability that a stopped motorist of that race gets a citation, P(citation|race).  The probability that a motorist who gets a citation is of that race, P(race|citation).   The first two probabilities can be calculated from the tables, and the final probability can be calculated using Bayes’ theorem. You also will need to add a graph of the racial breakdown of stopped motorists, and find the actual racial breakdown of the city’s population (or the metropolitan area, since motorists who are stopped may not live in the city itself).  Here's an example of Hartford, CT so that you can see how it is done.  First, we'll calculate the probabilities we need for Hartford. Let's get the data from the table:   To calculate the probability that a stopped motorist is of a particular race, we need to add up all the categories to see how many stops there were total. In this case, there were   Now we can calculate the probability that a stopped motorist was of a particular race. For example, let's look at Hispanic motorists - what is the probability that a motorist who was stopped is Hispanic?  \\frac{5072}{18435} = 0.2751  27.51% of stopped motorists in Hartford were Hispanic. If you look online, you'll see that the Hartford metropolitan area is 16% Hispanic, so the percentage of stopped motorists who are Hispanic is much higher than you would expect.  We can complete these calculations for the other racial groups listed. We get 0.95% Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI), 38.54% Black, 0.15% Other, and 32.84% White. How do these compare to the racial demographics of the Hartford metropolitan area?  Now let's look at our next calculation - the probability that someone of a particular race receives a citation if they are stopped. Here, since we're looking at a conditional probability, we only want to divide by the total number of stopped motorists who were of a particular race:   There is a 79.8% chance that a white motorist who has been stopped receives a citation. We can repeat this for the other groups, and we get 73.3% for AAPI motorists, 58.48% for Black motorists, 52.80% for Hispanic motorists, and 58.62% for motorists of other races. These percentages are all pretty different - what could explain the differences?  Finally, we need to calculate the . For this, we'll use Bayes' Theorem.    So 35.18% of stopped motorists who receive citations are Black. We can repeat this calculation for the other groups as well, getting 1.09% for AAPI motorists, 22.68% for Hispanic motorists, 0.14% for other racial groups, and 40.91% for White motorists.  Each member contributing to a particular city should do or check all of the calculations for that city. You can also check the answers and offer to help your fellow students working on the other cities. After everyone is done with their calculations, the class will go over the calculations and discuss the results. The contributors from each group will discuss the results they found, and then the class will discuss as a whole what this tells us about racism and policing stops in these cities.

  "title": "Understanding the Issue",
  "body": " Understanding the Issue  In the wake of racial justice protests in 2020, the public’s attention was also turned to the presence of police in schools, and the disproportionate impact that this presence has on students of color, primarily Black and Indigenous students. According to the National Center for Education Statistics , 61.4% of the public schools in 2017-2018 had one or more security staff. The number of police officers in schools especially exploded after the mass shooting in Columbine High School in 1999, as a consequence of which the government began to offer federal grants to schools for hiring police officers in an effort to increase school security. Twenty years later, over 200,000 students are being referred to law enforcement every year . Some of these referrals are arrests with or without charges filed, while others are citations. Students are referred to law enforcement for offenses as minor as talking back to a teacher or having a fight with a classmate . Because students who have contact with law enforcement are more likely to drop out of school and\/or end up incarcerated , this increased criminalization of youth behavior has become known as the school-to-prison pipeline. However, contact with law enforcement is not the only problem. Closely related to it is the problem of school discipline. In 2017-18, over 2.5 million students received an out-of-school suspension, and over 2.6 million received an in-school suspension . Frequent suspensions can also lead to dropout , and, as they are usually at the discretion of teachers and administrators, can be used indiscriminately  , leading to disparities.  In this module, we begin to explore the school-to-prison pipeline. After the completion of this module, you are encouraged to do more research on the topic, especially if you have not been personally affected by the overpolicing and overdisciplining in schools. It is important to acknowledge that neither race nor gender are discrete categories in the real world. However, all the data sources used in this module assume two genders and separate race categories. We will have to work with these limitations, but it is worth asking of all data we encounter: how were these data collected and what assumptions were made in collecting them?  In order to engage with this module, you will need to know some terminology:  School resource officer : School resource officers (SROs) are sworn law enforcement officers who are at a school part-time or full-time to maintain school safety and prevent crime. These officers may educate and counsel students, but otherwise have similar responsibilities as police officers. In particular, they can make arrests on school property.  School arrest : This is an arrest that happens on the school grounds, often, but not always, by the school’s SRO.  In-school suspension : When a student commits an offense that the school considers worthy of suspension, the suspension may be completed at the school. Suspended students do not attend regular classes or interact with their peers but are in a separate room where they are required to complete their assignments.  Out-of-school suspension : This is a more traditional form of suspension where students are physically barred from school grounds for one or more days.  Zero tolerance policies : School discipline policies that require predetermined serious consequences for particular offenses. Originally, these policies specifically addressed possession of weapons and drugs but were also expanded to others, such as defiant behavior or not following the school dress code.  Pushout : This term is often used instead of “dropout,” since it can be argued that students do not drop out of school unprompted, but as a consequence of policies and actions that make it difficult or impossible for them to remain in school.  Students with disabilities : For the purpose of looking at school discipline, students with disabilities are those who require special education services due to a disability. If a student has a disability but does not need accommodations for it, that student is not considered to fall under this category.  Truant : A student with a large number of absences, usually set by an official standard like a school board or regulatory agency. The descriptions of the following four terms were adapted from .  School counselor : These are professional staff members who counsel students and parents, consult with other staff, evaluate students, and implement guidance programs. They are among the first staff members to work with students who are struggling.  Social worker : Social workers assist students and families with issues such as poverty, homelessness, lack of access to healthcare, domestic violence, and other issues that might affect student performance at school.  Psychologist : School psychologists help diagnose problems of a personal and educational nature in students, and evaluate student social, emotional, and intellectual development.  Nurse : School nurses are qualified nurses who assist with the health needs of students at schools.  "

Strict school discipline is supposed to make parents feel safer sending their children to school, and it is also supposed to make the classroom environment more conducive to learning, with fewer distractions. Families of students who are not being disciplined might welcome, for example, presence of police in schools or zero tolerance policies. It could also be argued that teachers and administrators can benefit from not having to spend time and energy on students they view as disruptive. Finally, mass incarceration has been shown to be profitable, so the prison-industrial complex benefits as well.  "

  "body": " Ratios  A ratio is a mathematical tool for comparison. Ratios can be used either visually or numerically to compare quantitative data. With a ratio, you can either compare two parts of a group to each other, or you can compare a part of a group to the whole group. For this section, the focus is on the comparison of parts of the group to each other, specifically using the context of school support personnel.  First, there is a need to explore the different forms that a ratio can take. There are three main ways a ratio can be expressed:  A verbal form (the ratio of part to part)  A colon form (part: part)  A fraction form ( )  Each of these is read the same way as the verbal form, the ratio of part to part. The main significance is recognizing the notation when you come across it in readings. To avoid confusion, most writers will present ratios using a colon form (part: part) and reserve fraction form for comparisons against the whole. The same convention will be followed in this module and other portions of this text.  "

  "body": " Percents  Percents will be used heavily in this module. The percent formula is one that will be used throughout:   You can use this formula when you are missing the part, the whole, or the percent.   In 2013-14, there were approximately 49 million students enrolled in public schools. Out of those students, 5.3% were suspended or expelled. How many students were suspended or expelled?  In this case, we know the whole (49 million) and the percent (5.3), but we do not know the part. Therefore,   so , so about 2.6 million students were suspended or expelled in 2013-14.    In 2015-16, 43.42% of the students, or 21,700,551 students, were in schools with police officers. How many total students were enrolled in schools in 2015-16?  Now we know the part (21,700,551) and the percent (43.42), but not the whole, so in this case,   and , so there were 49,978,238 students enrolled in public schools in 2015-16.    In 2015-16, 61,812 students were arrested out of 49,977,268 who were enrolled nationally that year. What percentage of the student population was arrested that year?  We know the part (61,812) and the whole (49,977,268), but not the percent, so   or , which means that   so 0.124% of all students were arrested.   Note that the part does not have to be smaller than the whole. For example, 130 is 130% of 100. While in real life we cannot give more than 100% effort, there are situations in which percentages are over 100, for example if comparing two numbers (your pay may be 115% of your friend’s pay) or calculating change (for example, the price of coffee may have gone up 200%).  Percents are often used to represent change. For example, you may read that the number of suspended students in a school increased by 13% in a year. How is this change calculated?   There were 60,170 school arrests in 2013-14 school year, and 61,812 arrests in 2015-16. The total change in the number of school arrests between these two years is 61,812-60,170=1,642. To know what percent increase this is, we need to compare to the original number, in this case 60,170:   We convert a decimal to percent by multiplying by 100: since , it means that . Therefore, 0.027= 2.72%, so the number of arrests went up by 2.72%.  More generally, the formula for percent change from old value to new value is   where is total change, and dividing by start value gives percent change. Note that end value does not have to be bigger than start value, in which case we have a decrease and not an increase. For example, if the number of arrests went down from 61,812 to 60,170, then the total change would be -1,642, which is a 1,642\/61,812=0.0266=2.66% decrease (since ). Note that in this case we divided by 61,812 because that was the starting value, and the percent decrease is smaller than the percent increase, because the change of is the same in both cases, while the starting value is different.

  "title": "Probability",
  "body": " Probability   Probability is a specific type of ratio that allows the comparison of specific outcomes with the entire group of outcomes. We see probability expressed in three ways: as a fraction ranging from 0 to 1, as a decimal ranging from 0 to 1, and as a percentage ranging from 0% to 100%. All three of these expressions allow us to see a part and a whole, even if in the case of decimals and percentages where the whole is adjusted to be a multiple of ten. These different expressions can be seen in the Probability Scale below.    Probability scale giving examples of likelihoods between 0 and 1 as fractions, decimals, and percents.  Probability scale   We have two main ways that we think about probability. One is what is called a theoretical model. In the theoretical model, probabilities are driven by expectations of what we know. One classical example of a theoretical model is a coin flip where we know that there are two specific outcomes, or thinking about the months of the year from the probability scale. The second model is called an empirical model, and it is based on directly counting the occurrences of outcomes from events that have occurred. The empirical model is useful when the event being studied does not happen regularly. The process of selecting objects to model a process is called a probability experiment. A probability experiment offers a way to explore different outcomes. We can manually calculate the outcomes of a probability experiment, or use a tool like a simulator to help us understand a situation that is represented in a statement. Our choice to do this depends on the outcome or event that we might be looking at.  Both theoretical probability and empirical probabilities have similar building blocks. The sample space is the collection of all possible outcomes. An event consists of one or more outcomes. The probability is a ratio of the specific event of interest over the total number of outcomes. In this module, while we recognize the importance of understanding the underlying formulas for probability, we rely on simulations to develop skills that link initial statements of probability and the outcomes of experiments.  Consider the statement: “A student feels safe to be themselves at school.”  What outcomes are possible?  Are there reasons that might cause students to feel unsafe about being themselves?  Do you think a student being themselves could make another student uncomfortable? Why or why not?   The possible outcomes are {a student feels safe, a student does not feel safe}, and that makes sense. The probability of a student feeling safe to be themselves will result in 1 out of 2 outcomes, but can we reliably predict which outcome we see? Ideally, students feeling safe to be themselves at school should be the only outcome we expect to see. In reality, we find that students do not feel safe to be themselves at school for any number of reasons. Consider the following quote: “The teachers … they thought we were selling weed in school, they thought that me and her were both selling weed ‘cause like, the way we were dressing, ‘cause we were the only girls at that middle school that dressed like boys. So it was like 'now we’re bad'.” (non-gender conforming youth from Arizona) . In this quote, the student was exposed to a negative experience, accusations of illegal activity, because of choices associated with how they chose to express who they believed themself to be.  Making Sense: Think back to your experiences in school. Identify if there were similar incidents to the incident described above in your community. Do you think that how people were seen by others influenced their behavior, meaning if a label was applied to a person did they adapt to the label? Or do you think that the person stayed the same?   The second type of probability that we use is the empirical model. This comes from raw data. We tend to see this in the form of tables with numeric values, instead of the summary statistics. The basic use of the empirical model is very similar to the ideas from theoretical probability, and when we think about how to make sense of data from a table of data we think about what the theoretical model might have to look like.  The data in the table below is taken from a report by the American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) . The report states that students in these three states have the same general probability of being arrested per 10,000 students. For many states being arrested as a form of school discipline aligns with zero tolerance offenses that qualify for expulsion. For this reason, we may make a reasonable assumption that students may not be arrested multiple times as a form of school discipline.  Our first step to exploring the claim in the document is to think about the probability that we want to build. If you are a student going to school, when it comes to being arrested, you either get arrested at school or you don’t get arrested at school. So we have two groups of students, those that get arrested and those that don’t get arrested. We also happen to know about the number of students that get arrested, as well as how many students there are. This means that we have everything we need.  To find the probability of being arrested, we find the ratio of arrests to students for each state. For this example, we will model with Missouri and you can test your ideas on Arkansas and Rhode Island.   We can reduce this to a decimal figure, as finding common factors or a reduced form fraction is highly unlikely. This yields approximately 0.001625.Now we want to know how this fits with thinking about the probability of being arrested per 10,000 students. In other words, if the probability of getting arrested is 0.001625, this is about 0.1625%; how many arrests would that be among 10,000 students? We use this previously calculated value and solve an equation, to find a value out of 10000:   Solving this equation gives a value of 16 whole students in Missouri per 10000 based on the overall probability. The report claims that you have the same probability per 10000 in all three states. Can you verify the claim?   Those are the basics of probability. We can use these basic ideas of probability to help us build more complex models that can help us build more complex structures.    The complement  The first of these complex structures is the complement. We generally define the probability of a complement as the probability of an event of interest not happening. In , we identified that there were two specific groups: students that got arrested and students that did not get arrested. The probability of not getting arrested can be found in two ways: either by calculating it directly or by subtracting the opposite event from 1.   To find the probability of not getting arrested in school in Missouri, we know that there are 915,033 total students, and we also know that only 1,487 were arrested. So we know that the rest of the students were not arrested. So, we can subtract the arrested students from the total students to find the not arrested students, which gives us 913,546 students that were not arrested. We then find the ratio of not arrested students to total students: 913,546\/915,033=0.998375, or around 99.3875%.  We can also find this by using the fact that we know the probability of getting arrested. We start with the group of all students (1), and then we subtract out the group that represents getting arrested: 1 - 0.001625=0.998375, or 99.8375%.  We get the same mathematical answers from calculating the complement using either method. It is important to understand both methods because we have to think about the different types of information that we might have available. What is something that we notice in this scenario? Can a person be both arrested and not arrested at the same time? That leads us to our second special scenario.     Mutually exclusive events  One consideration in probability is the consideration of if events can occur at the same time. One example of events that cannot occur at the same time are an event and its complement, so thinking about our prior example a student cannot be both arrested and not arrested at the same time. This is an example of mutually exclusive events. But when we start to think about more complicated events, like can you be a specific race and be suspended from school, the events become more complicated. Understanding if events are mutually exclusive or not, allows for better and more accurate methods of calculating probabilities. Having more accurate probability calculations can help us make more informed judgments about issues.   Determine if you think the following event pairs are mutually exclusive or not. Explain to yourself why you think they are or are not mutually exclusive. What information did you use to make your decisions?  Event Pair A: Being Black and Getting suspended from school  Event Pair B: Being truant and Having regular school attendance  Event Pair C: Making good grades and Being disciplined in school  Following up: Based on models we have looked at, we realize that being Black and getting suspended can happen together, so those events are not mutually exclusive. When I know that being truant means not attending school regularly, I realize that the events in Event pair B are complements and have to be mutually exclusive. Event pair C is the most difficult to really take apart. Common sense-wise and experience-wise it seems like maybe the people who got good grades didn’t get in real trouble at school, but then again there is no reason why they couldn’t get into trouble. This means that they have to be not mutually exclusive events.       Independent Events  There is another way to think about multiple outcomes, and this happens when the events happen independently. In independent events, two separate events happen that have the same underlying probability, or at least we would like to think that they should (refer to for more detail). This is the crux of many arguments about school discipline. For an event to be independent, the underlying probability of the event should be the same across all subgroups. Consider an event like being enrolled in the reduced lunch program. If the probability of enrollment is approximately the same for all racial subgroups, then being in the reduced lunch group and the being in racial subgroups are independent. From your experience, do you think this is always the case? Feel free to use any relevant examples.   Let’s look at an example of how the math of independence works. For calculations, we assume that individual events are independent.   Black students have a 17% chance of being suspended. Suppose two separate Black students get called to the principal's office. Let’s explore the probability of both students receiving the same outcome, meaning either both students get suspended or neither student gets suspended. We will assume that the students’ visits to the principal are for separate offenses. What is the probability that both students are suspended?   What is the probability that neither student is suspended?  First, we need to know the probability of not being suspended. Recall, this is called the complement.   Now, we can use this to calculate the probability of neither being suspended when called to the principal’s office.   When we have independent events that occur in a sequence, we use multiplication to help us determine the probability. These are the essential mathematical pieces that we need to help us evaluate claims about the school to prison pipeline. Let’s dig a little deeper.    "

We will use data collected by official agencies and organizations as it is the most reliable. However there will always be issues of incorrect reporting, and all data should therefore be considered with the understanding that the information it provides is not perfectly accurate.    What is the School-to-Prison Pipeline?  In this introduction to the module, you will begin to think about the school-to-prison pipeline through engaging with a quote and an infographic. Rather than give you data or answers, this section gives you an opportunity to begin asking your own questions.    What, if anything, do you know about the school-to-prison pipeline?  Read the following excerpt from : “He was always a good boy. Polite,” his grandmother says. “He was raised to be respectful.” So how did he end up in prison? “It’s like they greased the chute. Back when he was in the 9th grade, Kyron got into a fight. Boys fight. Always have. No guns, no knives, just two boys tussling. Next thing I know he is locked up. That’s just crazy! It’s wrong.” What is your reaction to this quote? Write at least three different things.How might the content of this quote be related to mathematics?  Consider the following infographic :   Infographic with data about school suspensions and arrests.  School-to-prison pipeline infographic  What do you notice about its content? What do you wonder about its content? There is no right or wrong way to notice and wonder, so please list as many observations and questions as you can. Are any of your noticings and wonderings related to math?    This topic may be new to you, and it also may be one that personally affects you. In this module we are primarily focusing on two aspects of the school-to-prison pipeline: school discipline (such as suspensions) and the presence of police in schools. If you have personal experiences with school discipline and police in schools, please engage with this module at your own pace and comfort level. If you know little or nothing about these topics, the following sections will provide you with more information about the problem.  We will investigate the presence of police in schools first, and will then move on to discipline. Whether in contact with teachers, school administrators, or law enforcement, we will see that many students get punished for their actions, and in a variety of ways. We will want to know if these punishments are warranted and who is affected by them the most.    History of police in schools   In this part of the module you will learn about the presence of police in schools. Before you read on, answer these questions:    What do you know about police officers in schools?  Did you go to a school with a school resource officer (SRO)?  Why would schools have SROs?       School resource officers in schools  Consider the table below, giving the number of school resource officers, number of public schools, and the number of public schools with school resource officers, by full- and part-time school resource officer status, for selected years from 2003–04 to 2015–16 :   You can also view this table in CODAP , where you can also do calculations for some of the questions. You may want to watch the Simple formulas tutorial to figure out how to do calculations in CODAP.  NOTE: In 2003–04, schools reported on school resource officers present at their school on a regular basis. In 2005–06, 2007–08, 2009–10, and 2015–16, schools reported on school resource officers present at their school at least once a week.   Give at least three observations you can make about the data in the table.  How much did the number of SROs in schools change between 2003-04 and 2015-2016? Give the total and percent change.  What percentage of schools had SROs in 2003-2004? What percentage of schools had SROs in 2015-2016? How did the percentage change?  Why do you think the number of SROs has gone up so much since 2003?  Consider the graph below, based on data from NCES .   Bar graph of prevalence of SROs by free and reduced lunch.  Securty staff by free and reduced lunch  What does the graph tell you about which schools are more and less likely to have school resource officers?    You probably notice from doing this exploration that the number of SROs and the number of schools with SROs has gone up. According to , “Following the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, President Clinton called for the first round of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants as a response that would allow for school\/police partnerships focused on 'school crime, drug use, and discipline problems.'' COPS is a unit of the U.S. Department of Justice. After the Sandy Hook tragedy in 2012, President Obama allocated another $45 million into COPS to fund additional school police. Federal grants were supplemented by state grants and local monies to sustain SRO programs.”  In other words, highly publicized school shootings were part of the impetus for increased presence of police in schools, even though school shootings are statistically very rare .    Summary  The presence of police officers in schools has significantly increased since 1999 in response to the Columbine High School and other shootings. The majority of public schools have a part-time or full-time SRO on campus, though schools with a higher percentage of free and reduced lunch eligibility are more likely to have an SRO. In the next section we will look at other supports that have been considered important for preventing school shootings and for improving well-being of students.     Presence of other student supports in schools   It has been argued that to prevent shootings (and for many other reasons), schools should invest in supporting students’ mental and physical well-being. However, in most states, there is a shortage of nurses, social workers, psychologists, and counselors in schools. In this section, you will compare numbers of school support staff (including SROs) in different states.  Before you continue, answer the following questions:    Was there a nurse, social worker, psychologist, and\/or counselor in schools you went to?  How common do you think these support staff are in schools?      We will first look at Delaware and Washington, DC as examples, and then you will have a chance to look at your own location if it is different from these two.   School support staff in Delaware  Use the following Geogebra applet to help you explore the following guiding questions about school support staff in the state of Delaware .  Which pieces look to be similar in size? Are there relationships between the piece sizes?  Show the names of the sections. Use this to help you refine your discussion above.  Now select the option that allows you to see the number that corresponds with each section. Do the numeric values change any of the relationships that you developed?  Do you think you would have made the same comparisons if you had known the numbers first instead of focusing on the visual representation?    In this exploration, certain pieces were generally the same size even though they did not hold the same numeric value. Let’s take a minute to explore that difference between the visual representation and the numerical data.   Exploration: School support staff in Washington DC  Examine the following table with data for the school support staff in the Washington DC school district .    Look at the numbers for the groups and make comparisons between them. Are there any exact ratios, meaning any comparisons between groups that are identical or can be combined to be identical?  Thinking about probability, which type of support staff has the highest probability? Which type of support staff has the lowest probability?  Critical thinking: How does the ratio of (Law Enforcement + Security Guards):(Counselors + Social Workers + Psychologists + Nurses) look? Why would we be interested in this ratio? Were you expecting it to be closer together or further apart? How does this help you think about the school-to-prison pipeline?  Critical Thinking: Building on the idea from the previous question, what groups of support staff do students have the highest probability of encountering? How does this help you think about the school-to-prison pipeline?    In the next exploration you will have a chance to look at your state or a state that you are interested in.   Numbers in your state  Read the following excerpt from :  \"Given the importance of these providers, experts and professional organizations provide recommended student-to-SBHM provider ratios. The American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of 250 students per counselor. The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) recommends a ratio of 500-700 students per school psychologist, depending on the comprehensiveness of services being provided. School Social Work Association of America (SSWAA) recommends that social work services should also be provided at a ratio of 250 students to one social worker. Several states, along with the American Nurses Association, recommend a ratio of one school nurse to 750 students in healthy student populations.\"  Consider the table adapted from that gives the numbers of counselors, social workers, psychologists, nurses, teachers, law enforcement, and security guards in U.S. public schools by state in 2015-2016. You can find the table in CODAP or in Google Sheets (this sheet is view only). Note that the numbers of teachers, law enforcement, and security guides are provided for your information only. You will not need this information.   Select a state. You can choose the state where you currently live, the state in which you were born, the state where you went to school, or even just a state that interests you. How many students went to school in that state in 2015-2016? (Note: Hawaii and Florida have data that may have been underreported. If you choose one of these two states, you will have to decide how to deal with the missing or incomplete information.)  Calculate the number of counselors, school psychologists, social workers, and nurses that should have been employed in that state’s public schools in 2015-2016 according to the recommended ratios from the paragraph. If you wish, you can use CODAP to calculate the answers.  Compare your calculated answers with actual numbers of counselors, social workers, psychologists, and nurses in the table for your chosen state. How do the numbers compare?  What did you learn from this investigation and what do you still wish to know?      Summary  The majority of public schools have a part-time or full-time SRO on campus, but not counselors, social workers, psychologists, and nurses. This is true nationwide, with some exceptions.    In the next section, we will get to the central problem with school discipline: that it affects different populations very differently. We will first look at arrests and then at suspensions.     Who gets arrested in schools   In this part of the module, you will learn about school arrests. You will look at some national statistics to draw conclusions about disparities that exist in school arrests with respect to race and ability.  Before you continue, answer the following questions:    How often do you think students are arrested at school?  Why do you think students are arrested at school?       School arrests  There were over 204,000 referrals to law enforcement in 2015-2016 in U.S. public schools, almost 52,000 of which were school arrests. The actual number is likely higher due to underreporting.  Consider the table, created using data from CRDC , that gives rates of school arrests by race and disability status by state per 10,000 in 2015-2016. Because the table is large, it is linked: School arrest rates per 10,000 by state, 2015-2016 . This table is a view only Google Sheet. You can create your own copy if you want to edit it.  You can find the table in the CODAP file School arrests: rates only , where you can manipulate the data and do calculations with it. If you are interested in total numbers of arrests and not just the rates, you can find them in the CODAP file School arrests: all . Review the Simple formulas tutorial if you need help doing calculations in CODAP.   What do you notice about this table? What do you wonder? Remember that there is no right or wrong way to notice and wonder, but try to include mathematical observations.  Consider the data: How do you think the data in this table were collected? What do the data tell us and what are they unable to tell us? What biases may be present in how the data were collected and summarized?  Are there groups in the table that are mutually exclusive? Explain your reasoning.  Are there groups that are not mutually exclusive based on the information provided? Explain your reasoning.  The table gives rates per 10,000. For example, the 10.26 in Arrests per 10000 column for all of United States means that for every 10,000 students in the United States, around 10 were arrested. The arrest rate for students with disabilities in 2015-2016 was 20.69 per 10,000. Who do you think was more likely to be arrested in 2015-2016: students with disabilities or students without disabilities? How do you know?  Are there any particular groups of students who seem to be arrested more than others? What is your evidence for your conclusion?  Are there any particular states or regions that seem to arrest students more than others? What is your evidence for this conclusion? To answer this question you can make a graph in CODAP. For example, you can drag the state attribute to the x-axis and one of the arrest rates to the y-axis.  If students from one group are arrested more than is their share of the population, we say that they are disproportionately arrested. Consider the stacked bar graph created from CRDC data:   Stacked bar graph of enrollment and school arrests by race.  School enrollment and arrests by race  Note that the graph combines Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students because the percentages of their arrests are all very low and would be hard if not impossible to see on the graph. Of the five groups in the graph, which are disproportionately arrested in schools?  Would you say that students with disabilities are also disproportionately arrested in schools? How do you know?  (Optional) There is no information about the breakdown of students arrests by offense. However, media have reported numerous stories of students being arrested for minor infractions. If you are interested, you can find some examples in the document Articles about individual instances of discipline.      Summary  Large numbers of arrests are made in schools every year. The arrests are disproportionately among Black students and students with disabilities.  In the next section we will look at a more common form of school discipline: suspensions.   Who gets suspended from school   In this part of the module, you will learn about school suspensions and begin to make connections between school discipline and incarceration.  Before you continue, answer the following questions:    Why do you think students get suspended from school?  Are all groups of students equally likely to get suspended or are some groups suspended more than others?       Prison population simulation  One tool that is used to model and understand probability is simulation. In this part of the module, we will be using a simulation to help us explore different probability scenarios to see which behaves most like our target. We can determine if information from an empirical model provides a stable foundation for a theoretical model, meaning it can be replicated or nearly replicated over a number of trials. We can also use a theoretical model to produce simulated samples which can let us know if different empirical models are valid. In this exploration, you will examine a data table that shows the overall population for men's prisons by race . Then you will examine three different simulations to see which one you think would be most likely to produce the prison population given. In reading the output from the simulations, there is an overall summary column presented at the left, which shows the mean proportion for each race for all of the trials. In the center, there are the summaries from each trial, meaning it shows the proportion for each race in each trial. Then in the far right hand column, the raw data is shown. The simulations model the selection of 50 individual prisoners in 25 repeated samples. The variable being simulated is prisoner race because that is what we are interested in modeling. Before you start working with the simulations (where you only need to select “start” to collect data), think about strategies that you can use to see if you think a model will match.    Simulation A represents the general population according to the US Census.  Simulation B represents the percentages of students suspended in schools.  Simulation C represents the percentages with all groups being evenly distributed.   The three simulations did not present an exact match to the prison population, but which model do you think was the closest to the prison population model?  What factors helped you make your decision about fitting the model?  Do you think that this single variable (prisoner race) was enough to help you make a decision about the model? What additional information would you think would be useful, if any?  The simulations automatically calculated the proportions of each population group. Explore the data that was produced in the simulations. How does the selection of an individual in the simulation influence the calculated proportion?   Notes about probability: For the exploration you just completed, the outcomes of the probability experiment you conducted were the prisoners that were being simulated. There was also a specific group that was counted to create each proportion. These specific groups were the races of interest being counted. The probability is a ratio of the specific outcome of interest over the total number of outcomes. In the simulations, we looked at different races as the specific outcomes. It may be helpful to revisit the exploration with this definition and see if any of your ideas change.     Analyzing school suspension data  Students can receive in-school or out-of-school suspensions. In this investigation, we focus on out-of-school suspensions only.  Consider the table, created using data from CRDC , that gives numbers of students with one or more out-of school suspension by race and disability status and by state in 2015-2016. Because the table is large, it is linked: Out-of-school suspensions by state, 2015-2016 . It is a view only Google Sheet, so you need to create your own copy if you want to edit it.  The CODAP file Out of school suspensions contains this same information. In this investigation, you will analyze the data in the table.   Can you make some observations about the table just from looking at it? If so, what observations can you make?  Make one or more graphs in CODAP to help you make sense of the table. Remember that you have to drag an attribute to the x-axis and that you may also drag an attribute to the y-axis to make a meaningful graph.  What are the advantages of giving only total numbers of suspensions and not rates?  What are disadvantages of giving only total numbers of suspensions and not rates?  Create a formula in CODAP or use a calculator to calculate some suspension rates from the table (e.g., rates for your state by race or for a particular race by state). What do these rates tell you about how suspensions vary by state and\/or race?     Summary  As is the case with arrests, Black students and students with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined at school. While we did not look at gender in this module, it is worth noting that boys get suspended much more than girls, though racial disparities for girls’ suspensions are more pronounced.  In the last part of the module, it may become more clear where the term school-to-prison pipeline comes from. As it turns out, students who are disciplined at school are more likely to leave school and have increased interactions with law enforcement.     Where is the pipeline?  In this part of the module, we return to the concept of the school-to-prison pipeline and look at some connections between suspensions, school pushout, and incarceration.  Before you continue, answer the following question:  What long-term consequences may there be for students who are suspended from school or arrested at school?   Data from Texas  In 2011, researchers from the Council of State Governments Justice Center in partnership with the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A & M University published a report based on data from all public school students in Texas who were in seventh grade in 2000, 2001, and 2002. The researchers followed these students for at least six years, with access to academic and juvenile records. Among the researchers’ findings was that only 3% of the offenses for which students are disciplined are ones where by law schools are required to suspend or expel. The other 97% are at administrators’ discretion.  The study also found that 59.6% of all the students were disciplined one or more times and 40.4% were not. The table below summarizes some of the outcomes for the different groups of students.    Using what you now know about ratios, percents, and probability, explain whether the term “school-to-prison pipeline” is justified for the students from this study.  What else would you like to know to better answer this question?      Summary  Students who were disciplined at school in Texas between 2000 and 2002 were much more likely to be held back a grade, drop out, or have contact with juvenile justice. These school discipline actions were 97% of the time at the administrators’ discretion and not mandated by school policies; and they had a lasting impact on a large number of students .  Numerous studies have found that students who are arrested at school or who have been suspended are more likely to drop out of school and have continued contact with law enforcement. A recent study found that in Charlotte-Mecklenberg school district in North Carolina, students who were assigned to schools with higher suspension rates were significantly more likely to be arrested and incarcerated as adults, and less likely to attend a four-year college. Furthermore, the results were independent of which students were assigned to the schools (the study took place during a redrawing of school boundaries when over 50% of the students in the district were assigned to different schools), or of factors like teacher turnover. Instead, the suspension rates were most influenced by school policies and leadership.  Since Black students and students with disabilities are disproportionately disciplined and arrested and schools, it follows that they are also disproportionately likely to drop out of school and have continued troubles with the law. This is why the school-to-prison pipeline disproportionately affects these students.   "

  "body": " Prison population simulation  One tool that is used to model and understand probability is simulation. In this part of the module, we will be using a simulation to help us explore different probability scenarios to see which behaves most like our target. We can determine if information from an empirical model provides a stable foundation for a theoretical model, meaning it can be replicated or nearly replicated over a number of trials. We can also use a theoretical model to produce simulated samples which can let us know if different empirical models are valid. In this exploration, you will examine a data table that shows the overall population for men's prisons by race . Then you will examine three different simulations to see which one you think would be most likely to produce the prison population given. In reading the output from the simulations, there is an overall summary column presented at the left, which shows the mean proportion for each race for all of the trials. In the center, there are the summaries from each trial, meaning it shows the proportion for each race in each trial. Then in the far right hand column, the raw data is shown. The simulations model the selection of 50 individual prisoners in 25 repeated samples. The variable being simulated is prisoner race because that is what we are interested in modeling. Before you start working with the simulations (where you only need to select “start” to collect data), think about strategies that you can use to see if you think a model will match.    Simulation A represents the general population according to the US Census.  Simulation B represents the percentages of students suspended in schools.  Simulation C represents the percentages with all groups being evenly distributed.   The three simulations did not present an exact match to the prison population, but which model do you think was the closest to the prison population model?  What factors helped you make your decision about fitting the model?  Do you think that this single variable (prisoner race) was enough to help you make a decision about the model? What additional information would you think would be useful, if any?  The simulations automatically calculated the proportions of each population group. Explore the data that was produced in the simulations. How does the selection of an individual in the simulation influence the calculated proportion?   Notes about probability: For the exploration you just completed, the outcomes of the probability experiment you conducted were the prisoners that were being simulated. There was also a specific group that was counted to create each proportion. These specific groups were the races of interest being counted. The probability is a ratio of the specific outcome of interest over the total number of outcomes. In the simulations, we looked at different races as the specific outcomes. It may be helpful to revisit the exploration with this definition and see if any of your ideas change.  "

  "body": " Data from Texas  In 2011, researchers from the Council of State Governments Justice Center in partnership with the Public Policy Research Institute at Texas A & M University published a report based on data from all public school students in Texas who were in seventh grade in 2000, 2001, and 2002. The researchers followed these students for at least six years, with access to academic and juvenile records. Among the researchers’ findings was that only 3% of the offenses for which students are disciplined are ones where by law schools are required to suspend or expel. The other 97% are at administrators’ discretion.  The study also found that 59.6% of all the students were disciplined one or more times and 40.4% were not. The table below summarizes some of the outcomes for the different groups of students.    Using what you now know about ratios, percents, and probability, explain whether the term “school-to-prison pipeline” is justified for the students from this study.  What else would you like to know to better answer this question?   "

  "body": " Understanding the Issue   In , Joseph Biden, Jr., said during his winning campaign for U.S. President that he would forgive in debt for all those who had taken out student loans. In June , in the Education Department's largest student loan forgiveness action currently in effect, it eliminated billion in debt owed by former students of the now-defunct for-profit Corinthian Colleges system, which collapsed in amid federal investigations and lawsuits .  One year later, on August , , President Biden announced a plan that would forgive for a subset of lower-income student debtors who had attended both for-profit and nonprofit colleges, then an additional in student debt for an additional subset of highest-need borrowers. This plan was immediately controversial, quickly challenged by many Republican-led states, and unanimously blocked by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on November ,  . This injunction preventing debt forgiveness from coming into effect was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments in February on the case.  Finally, on January , , President Biden proposed a novel income-based federal student loan repayment plan . Why did President Biden feel the political impetus to forgive student loan debt? What were the political causes of and blowback to these debt forgiveness actions, and why were they so controversial? Whether or not Biden's loan forgiveness policy is overturned by the Supreme Court, what would its impacts be, and should future Presidents and legislators continue to advocate for student loan forgiveness?  In this module, we begin by attempting to understand student loan debt through an analysis of media and political claims and the academic literature. Specifically, we ask:  What are the causes of the current level of student loan debt?  Who benefits from the high rate of student loan debt in the U.S.?  How does the load of student loan debt impact college students' and graduates' lives?  What factors, including time and the nonprofit status of a college, impact the burden of debt faced by students?  How do historical and present inequities, such as systemic racism, impact student loan debt load and default rates?  What is the federal government doing in response to the large amount of student loan debt in the U.S.?

Amazingly, this led to an invitation to testify before Congress on September 10, 2019, on the student loan debt crisis.    Hasan Minhaj presents information on student loans.

What are three ways in which Navient has mistreated borrowers?  What is an income-based repayment plan? What is forbearance, and why has it negatively affected borrowers when Navient encourages borrowers to enter forbearance instead of income-based repayment?  In what ways does Minhaj argue that the Department of Education has \" failed borrowers\"?    The highest proportion of student loan debt (the amount of debt held per student) is held by students at for-profit colleges , which are colleges that are not funded by taxes but instead depend on federal student aid (guaranteed by the government) and the tuition dollars that students pay to attend, often backed up by federal student aid. Contrast this situation with the vast majority of colleges and universities in the U.S., which are nonprofit institutions, which are usually run by a not-for-profit institution, religious organization, or government and hence often receive funding from taxes or a particular religious group.  The greatest proportion of defaults (see ) on student debt in occurred at the University of Phoenix, Walden University, Nova Southeastern University, Capella University, and Strayer University , of which all but Nova are for-profit.  Almost all students are eligible to receive federal student loans, which are student loans funded by the U.S. federal government through programs such as Pell Grants. Federal loans are either subsidized (that is, interest payments are covered by the federal government for a period including the student's time at a college or university ; such loans are restricted to undergraduates only) or unsubsidized (in which case borrowers must pay the interest).  In contrast, private student loans are loans offered by non-governmental companies which are heavily advertised, do not offer the relatively generous forbearance and deferred-payment options that federal loans do, and charge interest while the borrower is in college. Often, private student loan interest rates are higher even than those of unsubsidized federal student loans. Since many students do not have a credit history, federal student loans do not require proof of, or a co-signer attesting, \"creditworthiness\", or evidence of past ability to repay debt; as of the s, most private student loans required such proof . Additionally, students who declare bankruptcy are unable to discharge private student loans, meaning borrowers who have no money are still required to pay private corporations back for student loans . Therefore, the U.S. government earns more income from student loans, but profits less, on average, than private student loan companies.  Employers benefit from the number of students who attend college, including those who could not otherwise attend without taking out student loans. \"Credentialism\", the continuing growth in employers' expectations of postsecondary education on the part of their employees, has been called a key driver of student loan debt . In , earnings were stagnant for most workers, but declined rapidly for workers with no college education. This pressures people to seek a college education whether or not they can afford it.  Finally, a article in The Atlantic  implies that middle-class college graduates were able to advance their cause over other causes championed by more marginalized groups because they have higher relative political power compared to non-college graduates. Certainly, as we will see below, middle-class college graduates benefit a great deal from President Biden's student debt cancellation policy.  "

Unlike scholarships or grants, student loans must be repaid.   In July , student loan debt in the U.S. totaled trillion. In , the average debt held by a student loan borrower was  .   Default   Defaulting on a loan means a borrower stops making the required payments on that loan. When someone defaults on a student loan, the federal government is allowed to withhold their tax refund, paycheck, or (for older adults) Social Security payments.   The average person to default on their student loans owes less than , suggesting that defaulters are make significantly lower incomes than the average student loan borrower. Those borrowers who did not complete a college degree are three times as likely to default as those who completed . Moreover, half of Black borrowers who took out loans in - had defaulted after years.   Pell Grant  The Pell Grant is a federal government grant which provides money for college to low-income students that does not have to be repaid, unlike student loans.   Those who receive a Pell Grant, signaling they are low-income without adding to their debt, are still disproportionately likely to default on their student loans .   For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Colleges  All public and most private colleges ( of all colleges in  ) are not-for-profit institutions , meaning they invest their profits back into the institution and often operate under independent governance.  A college that is not registered as a not-for-profit institution is called a for-profit college .    Independent Governance  A college or university operates under independent governance if their leadership is required to focus on factors other than generating a profit when providing an education .   A government study in found that the default rates for student borrowers at for-profit institutions, which are not required to focus on factors other than profit, were nearly double compared to community colleges; for-profit institutions have more expensive tuition and fees than community colleges, have lower graduation rates, and have less valuable credentials .   Tuition  Tuition is the amount of money charged by a college for instruction by faculty.    Student Fees  A student fee is a sum of money charged to students at a school, college, or university in addition to tuition. Student fees may be used to support student organizations and activities, sports teams, exercise facilities, class supplies such as art materials, or anything else beyond the cost of instruction.   The United States is a relative outlier compared to other nations in the high cost of college tuition and fees. For example, according to a late study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. has the highest average tuition costs of the OECD member countries . This tuition has increased over time.  "

Does this table (and the supplement on the number of students in grad school) back up the suggestion of this Atlantic article  that the cause of increased student debt is that more students are taking out loans to enroll in grad school? Why or why not?    Use TuitionTracker to describe recent trends at your own institution in the same way. Is your college or university better or worse in amount of student debt than the average in the US? The average for institutions of the same type?     Compare the total amount paid in student debt for various racial groups using this table .   Does it seem like any racial groups are being disproportionately saddled with student loan debt? How can we compare, say, debt held by white vs. Asian students to see whether the difference is larger than we'd expect? Well, first we need to quantify the idea of what we'd expect ...what does this mean? Create an expected frequency table for what you'd expect to see if there were absolutely no racial differences in student debt.  Compute the difference between the observed count for each race and the expected count . What do you notice?  What if we averaged all the \\textquoteright s for each racial group? This is effectively the idea of a chi-squared test for goodness-of-fit , which is used by statisticians to determine whether any differences observed are small enough to be due to chance or large enough that they give evidence of a difference. What would the equation for this average look like?  We'll use a computer to perform this test in a minute. First, what groups do you think are disproportionately likely\/unlikely to hold student loan debt? What racial groups have a higher\/lower debt burden per person?  Now, enter this data into an app such as RStudio or an online tool. In RStudio, run this code to do a chi-squared test. (In a statistics class, walk through the steps.) Output the -value (the likelihood the observed differences are due to chance alone) and \\textbf{residuals}, which are basically scaled versions of the s for each racial group. Which are highest? Lowest? Is there evidence of racial bias?     If these materials are being used for a course in, say, introductory statistics for STEM fields or a higher-level data science class, this is a good time to discuss linear regression with multiple predictors to formalize the effect of year and type of institution on tuition or race and year on student debt. However, since this text is primarily intended for courses without prerequisites targeted at majors and non-majors alike, such material is beyond the scope of this chapter.  "

  "body": " the Intersectional Inequities of Student Debt  The average undergraduate student who takes out student loans has around in debt by the end of their higher education, according to the U.S. Department of Education. However, this debt is not spread equitably by demographic category: of non-Hispanic-identifying Black families carry an education loan, compared to of non-Hispanic white families and of Hispanic-identifying families .  Student debt is also not equally spread among age groups; Millennials (who were - years old in ) total over billion in student loan debt, compared to a little over million of Gen Z (under in ), a little under million held by those - years of age in , a bit under million held by those - years old, and only around million held by those or older in  .  Since Black families have been prevented from amassing generational wealth through systemic racism (in which laws favor one racial group over another), the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, and mass incarceration, as well as continued implicit and explicit racism in public policy, housing (including the legacy of redlining, a policy which conitnued through ), private banking and lending, access to education, and hiring practices, Black folks are both more likely to have to take on debt to attend college and less likely to attain wealth due to a college education .  In particular, a study found that the average white college-educated parent contributed to their children's education, while Black parents contributed on average. This is true despite the fact that, when controlling by household type and economic situation, Black parents contribute more on average than white parents.  Lower-income Black parents are disproportionately likely to take out Parent PLUS loans, which is a loan provided by the U.S. Department of Education to the parents of college students. Parent PLUS loans are unsubsidized and charge a loan fee (added to each loan payment) of and an interest rate of as of  , adding a substantial financial burden to the parent borrower.  Under these circumstances, Black borrowers default on student loans five times more often that white borrowers . Therefore, the disproportionate load of student debt on Black borrowers is both a symptom of, and exacerbates, the racial wealth gap in the U.S., or the difference in total assets and debts between Black and white Americans.  Defaulting on federal student loan debt leads to consequences such as bad credit ratings, a decrease in tax refunds, the garnishment of wages, and removal of security clearances which are at times a condition of employment . The consequences for those who default include an inability to obtain loans to buy homes or cars, loss of wages, or loss of employment.  The data in this section come partly from a New York Times article by Ella Koeze and Karl Russell entitled ``The Toll of Student Debt in the U.S.'' An archived version of the article can be accessed here .   What are three things you notice about the graphs shown in the article? Explain what these particular things mean for students with debt.  What are three things you wonder about based on the article that are not answered in the article itself?  Do some research online and find reputable sources to answer your questions above.   "

The debt was forgiven only for single adults earning under a year and married couples earning under a year .  Student debt in the U.S. in , when President Biden proposed his student loan debt forgiveness plan, was roughly equal to the size of the economy of Brazil . Additionally, the amount of funding for higher education provided by state governments has declined from around in the s to slightly under in \\cite{koezeTollStudentDebt2022\"\/>.  An independent analysis by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business found that about two-thirds of the financial benefit from Biden's student loan forgiveness plan will be to households making or less per year, especially households earning between and a year . The impact to the U.S. budget will be between and billion.  The Wharton School also released the data in on the distribution of student loan forgiveness benefits by income.  Student Loan Debt Forgiven by Income Level      All Ages  Age -     Income Group  Percentage of benefit  Percentage of benefit    Bottom           21st to 40th percentile  22.89%  24.56%    41st to 60th percentile  30.90%  30.62%    61st to 80th percentile  23.19%  23.03%    81st to 90th percentile  8.06%  10.39%    91st to 95th percentile  1.70%  0.43%       shows the distribution of student loan forgiveness benefit by income under the Biden student loan forgiveness plan. Most of the debt forgiven would have accumulated for those in the - age group; hence, this column may be more representative of the plan's effects. No benefit is expected to go to the top of earners in either age group. Data from Wharton School of Business .  Assume for a moment that these policies stay constant for the next years (perhaps an unlikely assumption given the changes in policy between Presidential administrations as well as Supreme Court challenges).   What percentage of the benefit will your age and income group receive years from now?  If you are in one of the groups (single adults earning under a year and married couples earning under a year, plus an additional for Pell Grant recipients) that President Biden targeted for debt forgiveness in , what amount of debt will you have forgiven?  Do you believe that President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness policy is a good idea? Why or why not? Do its benefits for lower-income debtors outweigh its impats on the U.S. budget? Estimate whether your taxes will rise as a result and, if so, by how much, using a well-explained dimensional analysis.   The following note from the Wharton Budget Model , describes the income groups listed in : \"Estimate household income percentile thresholds for 2022 all age: 20%: $28,784; 40%: $50,795; 60%: $82,400; 80%: $141,096; 90% $212,209; 95%: $321,699; 99%: $961,711; 99.9%: $3,668,499.\"   Given this information, estimate the percentage of the student loan forgiveness plan your income group will receive.  The Congressional Budget Office , a nonpartisan organization within the legislative branch of the United States government, estimated the total cost of Biden's student loan forgiveness program at billion. Use this estimate, together with the information above, to estimate how much total debt relief (in U.S. dollars) your income and age group wlil receive years from now.     President Biden's loan forgiveness program involves an ``income cap'', which means that the program only applies to individuals who earn below or households who earn below each year. According to the Wharton analysis shown in Table , whether or not an income cap is applied, the most loan forgiveness would go to households earning between and a year.   What income percentile(s) in do these earners belong to?  Assuming that the loan forgiveness policy stays constant for the next years, estimate the percentage of loan forgiveness that will apply to these income percentile(s). Make the simplifying assumption that all student loan borrowers are individuals and not households.  Does the Wharton estimate make sense? Why or why not?     "

(0 = not at all, 4 = totally misleading) (In other words, when you look at the underlying data, does it support the article's point or not?)     "
