  "title": "A Note for Instructors",
  "body": " A Note for Instructors  Math for the People is designed to be used for an introductory college-level course in quantitative reasoning, with an emphasis on social justice. Unlike a traditional mathematics textbook, the text is organized by social justice topics, with each module teaching the mathematics concepts needed to understand and work for change in a particular social justice area.  Each module is designed to be independent, although there may be overlap. Instructors are encouraged to proceed through the modules in the order that they find suitable, or to choose modules in consultation with their students. Each module is designed to be completed in approximately two weeks of a standard 16-week semester, or one week of an 8-week quarter (6-8 class contact hours).  Each module is structured identically, beginning with introductory material about the social justice topic and a discussion of the parameters of the problem being discussed. Once students have a fundamental understanding of the topic, the module introduces them to mathematical skills which they can use to analyze the problem. Finally, each module culminates in a section which encourages students to use their mathematical skills to engage with the social justice topic.  Because the topics which we are discussing in this class can be emotionally charged and \"political,\" we encourage faculty to plan for this in advance. The University of Waterloo offers a comprehensive set of tips for facilitating discussion of difficult topics (Facilitating Effective Discussions. Centre for Teaching Excellence, University of Waterloo, CC-BY-NC-4.0 ), some of which are summarized below:   Establish ground rules for discussion. A suggested set of ground rules is provided in . You can ask the class if they have other rules they would like to add.  Encourage students to participate in multiple different ways, including verbal, written, and electronic participation. Some students may need more time to collect their thoughts for sharing.  Actively work to include all students in the discussion. Don't allow one or two students to dominate the conversation or discourage contradiction.  Group students and ask them to focus in one part of the issue and report back to the whole class. Sharing ideas with a small group can be more comfortable initially.  Be comfortable with silence. Long pauses are a natural part of discussion on difficult topics - if you fill the space too quickly, it can discourage active discussion.  Limit your own involvement. You can correct misinformation or enforce group rules, but the point of a discussion is to hear & value student input.   Instructors who use the textbook are encouraged to fill out the Math for the People Instructor's Feedback Form or to join our Hypothes.is group . Hypothes.is is an online annotation tool which allows you to make private annotations on public webpages. Once you create an account and join our group, you can install a browser plugin which will allow you to make comments directly on the textbook webpage. Those comments will be visible to anyone with access to the hypothes.is group.  "

  "body": " A Note for Students  This textbook is intended to guide you through the mathematics necessary to understand and work to create change in a number of politically charged areas. You may find areas where you disagree with the material presented or find that it challenges things you believe are true.  That's ok. Education, fundamentally, is about challenging what you already know and learning about new things. You may find, through your research and work in this class, that your views don't change. You may find that they do. Our goal, in Math for the People, is to present factual information and to teach you the quantitative tools you need to understand that information. We encourage you to look at other data, work through your own examples, and see how it agrees or disagrees with what is presented in the text. While we do not hesitate to present our own viewpoint, which we believe is supported by the quantitative data, these are complicated problems and there may be other solutions we're not considering.  In working through these topics with your class, we encourage you to follow the following guidelines, plus any additional guidelines that your class agrees on (these guidelines are adapted from ):   Listen to others, rather than just waiting for your chance to speak.  Don't interrupt or talk over your classmates.  Use \"I\" statements, like \"I believe,\" \"I think,\" \"I feel.\" There's a big difference between a statement like \"I believe X is true\" and \"X is true.\"  Support your arguments with evidence, especially with quantitative evidence.  Give everyone the chance to speak. If you feel like you are monopolizing the discussion, take a step back and give someone else the chance to talk.  Avoid personal attacks. You can disagree with someone's ideas without attacking that person.  Do not use language which is offensive or denigrates a particular group. Stereotypes and bigotry are inappropriate in the classroom.  If someone does say something offensive unintentionally, give them space to learn from their mistake. You can share your discomfort with the instructor, who will help them understand why what they said was hurtful.  Assume accountability for your words and actions.  Share the lesson, not the story. Students may share personal information in class which should remain confidential. You can talk about what you learned without sharing the personal details your classmate shared.   We encourage every student who uses the textbook to fill out the Student Feedback Form . This information will help us improve the textbook for students who use it in the future.  "

  "body": " Big Problem: Restricting Abortion Access  The Supreme Court's ruling in Row v Wade on January 22, 1973, gave people in the United States legal access to abortion across the United States. The ruling was based on the right to privacy which is protected by the 14th Amendment. Since this ruling, there have been numerous attempts to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 decision.  These attempts primarily arise when a state passes their own law defining when and how a person can legally get an abortion. When a state passes their own laws, the legality of these laws are often challenged by advocacy groups for access to abortion. These challenges are brought to the court system and can reach as high as the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has the right to decide which cases they will review. Their decision to see a case and\/or their decisions in these cases can change accessibility to legal abortion within the United States. This is precisely what happened on June 24, 2022.  In December 2021, the case Dobbs v. Jackson Womenâs Health Organization was argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. In this case, the Jackson Womenâs Health Organization and one of its doctors challenged that the Mississippiâs Gestational Age Act violated a constitutional right to abortion. This Act states:  \"[e]xcept in a medical emergency or in the case of a severe fetal abnormality, a person shall not intentionally or knowingly perform . . . or induce an abortion of an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen (15) weeks\"[Miss. Code Ann. Â§41â41â191]   Lower courts had ruled the Mississippi Gestational Age Act as unconstitutional because under the 1973 decision on Roe v. Wade, it was prohibited to ban abortions before a fetus was considered to survive outside a womanâs womb.  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court sided with Dobbs, who was the head of the Mississippi Health Department in 2018. This decision is based on the idea that access to abortion is not a constitutional right because, in fact, there is no inherent right to privacy or personal autonomy in the Constitution. Now that precedent has been set that there is no constitutional right to privacy, many other U.S Supreme Court cases are subject to be re-examined that could result in a major set-back to the civil rights movement. These include, but certainly not limited to, legality of same-sex marriages, inter-racial marriages, and contraception.  Immediately following this historical Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe, there were 16 states in which abortion became illegal, banned, or had trigger laws in place . Trigger laws donât take effect immediately or require some proactive intervention such as attorney general certification.  While the consequences of overturning Roe remains uncertain, what is not uncertain are peopleâs beliefs about abortion. A person typically identifies as \"pro-choice\" or \"pro-life\". In the following sections, we explore the logic of three topics at the center of peopleâs beliefs. These topics are bodily autonomy, inequity in abortion access, and when \"life\" starts.  "

  "title": "Simple Logic",
  "body": " Simple Logic   A mathematical statement is a sentence that is either true or false, but not both at the same time. For example, consider the following sentences:  The Supreme Courtâs ruling on Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973 gave people the right to access abortion legally all across the country  The Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 making abortion a federal crime within the United States.  Abortion should be illegal.    The first sentence is a sentence which is true, making the sentence a mathematical statement. The second sentence is false which also means that it is a mathematical statement. Lastly, the third sentence is an opinion which is neither true nor false. Therefore, the third sentence is not a mathematical statement. Determining if a sentence is a statement can be challenging as this causes us to challenge the difference between our individual belief systems and factual information. We will discuss this in further detail in our last section of this module.  Mathematical statements, or simply statements , are the building blocks to mathematical logic. While mathematicians primarily focus on statements that involve mathematics such as, \"The number 2 is greater than 0\", the methods used by mathematicians to make sense of their discipline can be applied to other topics which use critical thinking.  There are a series of operations that we can perform on statements to get new statements. This is analogous to taking two numbers and adding, subtracting, or multiplying to get a new number. In algebra, the letters , , and are often used to represent numbers. These are called variables . In logic we typically use the variables , , and to represent a statement. When we perform an operation on one or more statements, we will call the result a compound statement . It is important to note that the resulting statement is, in fact, a statement. This means that a compound statement must either be true or false, but not both at the same time.    Negating and Combining Statements with \"and\" and \"or\"   Negations  The negation of a given statement switches the truth value of the original statement. For example, the negation of \"Abortion is a federal crime\" is \"Abortion is not a federal crime\". Many times, a statement can be negated by inserting the word \"not\", or an equivalent word into the original statement. There are many ways to symbolically represent the negation of a statement. For this module, if we represent a statement by the variable , we represent the negation of by . We can use a logic calculator to see how the value of and are related. In the calculation above, the left most column represents the values for and the column under \"value\" represents the corresponding values for .    And & Or  As we can see, when is true, is false and vice versa.The calculator used above generated a truth table. A truth table is a table that will produce the truth values for compound statements based off of the statement variable which are typically placed to the left of the table and the truth values for the compound statement which are typically to the right in the table. We will use this truth table generator for the remainder of this module.  Two more common ways to make a compound statement is by taking two simple statements and combining them with either the word \"or\" or \"and\". For example, consider the two statements \" In August 2022, abortion is legal with not gestational limit in the state of New Jersey\"and \"In August 2022, abortion was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama\" . We can combine these statements in the following two ways:  In August 2022, abortion is legal with no gestational limit in the state of New Jersey or in August 2022, abortion was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama.  In August 2022, abortion is legal with no gestational limit in the state of New Jersey and in August 2022, abortion was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama.  These statements are a bit awkward and can be rewritten without losing their meaning as simply:  In August 2022, abortion is legal with not gestational limit in the state of New Jersey or was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama.  In August 2022, abortion is legal with not gestational limit in the state of New Jersey and was banned with no exception for rape or incest in the state of Alabama.  Both of these compound statements are true statements because the original simple statements are both true. The truth table for an \"or\" statement, more formally known as a disjunction is given below: The truth table for an \"and\" statement, more formally known as a conjunction is given next: The columns on the far left represent all possible truth values of the simple statements and used in the compound statement. The entries on the far left of each row represent the different truth value of the simple statements used in the compound statement. The final column on the far right represents the truth value of the compound statement for the given simple statement truth values. For example the second row in the truth table above reads \"When is true and is false, and is false\".     Equivalent Statements  Given a statement , we say that a statement is equivalent to if they have the same truth value. We denote equivalent statements, and , by . For example, because for corresponding values of and , these compound statements have the same truth results. This can be seen by examining the truth tables below:   Because equivalent statements have the same truth value, we can interchange one for the other without losing the meaning of a statement. Let's try the following example. You may find the following website helpful for entering in the symbols used in these calculators Propositional Calculus .    Determine which of the following statements is equivalent to :                 Not equivalent  Equivalent  not equivalent      The examples above are called DeMorganâs Laws. Summarizing DeMorganâs Laws:        There are many other equivalent statements, as we will see in the next section.    Implications (If-Then Statements)  An implication is a statement that has a premise and a conclusion such as, \"If I take birth control, then I canât get pregnant\". In this implication, the premise is the statement \"I take birth control\" and the conclusion is the statement \"I canât get pregnant\". With an implication, the truth value of the premise and conclusion determine the truth value of the actual implication. Given two statements and , the statement: if , then can be represented by and read as \"if , then \", \" implies \", \" only if \", and \" , if \". Below is the truth table for the implication \"if , then \":   The truth value of implications can be counterintuitive at times. This occurs primarily when the premise is false because the implication will always be true. For example the implications below are true since the implications in all are false:  If abortions are federally protected, then people will use abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies.  If abortions are federally protected, then people will not use abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies.  If abortions are a federal crime, then more women will be jailed.  If abortions are a federal crime, then more women will be jailed.  In these statements, it seems as if only one of the first two statements should be true and one of the last two statements should be true as the conclusions are negations of one another. However, all four statements are true.  It turns out that the only way for an implication to be false is when the premise is true and the conclusion is false. An example would be, \"If abortions are not a federally protected right, then no-one will get an abortion\".  Another counterintuitive concept that arises with implications is their negation. The negation, is equivalent to the statement . This is verified by examining their truth tables.      Verify that the following statements are not equivalent to using the truth table generator below:                  Not equivalent  Not equivalent  Equivalent  not equivalent      It is important to notice that the negation of an implication is not an implication. For example, the negation of \"If abortions are federally protected, then people will not use abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies\" is \"Abortions are federally protected and people use abortions to terminate unwanted pregnancies\" which is a false statement.

  "title": "Quantifiers",
  "body": " Quantifiers  A quantifier is a way of indicating quantity within a statement. We know words that indicate quantity such as all, many, some, or none. In logic, these are the words that are used as the quantifiers. They indicate how many of what have a particular attribute or quality. Consider the following examples:   Some abortions are medically necessary.   All children deserve to live.   No abortion supporter deserves a vacation.    One important tool that supports us when working with statements with quantifiers is the use of Venn Diagrams and set representations. Sets help us have a more clear perspective in forming negations and understanding the truth value of statements. Letâs start with the simple statements that use quantities, and then build to a more complicated statement like the one from the previous section, \"If abortions are not a federally protected right, then no one will get an abortion.\"  Let's consider the statement that some abortions are medically necessary. The word some is a quantifier. The reference set is the set of all abortions. The set of abortions for medical reasons is what we would consider a subset. Exploring the legitimacy of this subset is how we decide on strategies for negation. Our main strategy is driven by determining if there are abortions in the subset \"abortions for medical reasons.\" A quick web search can help us determine if there are abortions for medical reasons (see https:\/\/www.health.com\/news\/abortion-medically-necessary as an example), meaning that the set of abortions for medical reasons is not an empty set. This web article discusses that the medical reason may be for both the mother or the unborn fetus. We can use our understanding of the characteristics and membership of the sets to help us think further when working with statements about the sets.   A rectangle representing the set of all abortions with a blue circle contained inside this rectangle. The circle represents abortions needed for medical reasons.  A subset of abortions needed for medical reasons among the set of all abortions.   We can use the membership of the set and subset to help develop strategies for negating statements. As previously stated, negations switch the truth value of a statement. This would also be true for quantified statements, except the change happens by altering the quantity. We established previously that the statement \"Some abortions are medically necessary,\" is a true statement. So we need to think about ways to use quantity and set membership to change the truth value. In this case, our negation would be to find a false statement. Since we know that some abortions are for medical reasons, the most direct negation is to claim that no abortions are medically necessary. We know that this statement is false, as we can produce information about abortions that are medically necessary for the safety of the mother. The statement, \"No abortions are medically necessary,\" would propose that there is not an element in the set abortions for medical reasons.This switches the truth value from the original statement, \"Some abortions are medically necessary.\"  One question that you may have is why the statement, \"All abortions are medically necessary,\" is not a valid negation. It may in fact be a valid negation, but we have to meet some specific criteria for it to be valid. Letâs talk about what needs to happen for the negation with \"All abortions are medically necessary,\" to be valid. The statement implies that all of the abortions in the set of all abortions are also in the set of abortions for medical reasons. Now let's consider our original statement, \"Some abortions are medically necessary.\" It is logically equivalent to the statement, \"Not all abortions are medically necessary.\" The negation of this equivalent statement happens when we state that there are no members in the set of all abortions that are not also in the set of abortions for medical reasons. This is a more complicated process because it is not direct. We created an equivalent statement that was then negated. Typically the more steps that are involved in a process, the more room you have to make errors. Logic is no exception.  Let's now consider the statement, \"All children deserve to live.\" This is a common quantified statement that is offered in abortion debates. Let's discuss the sets, and think independently about potential subsets that can exist.   A rectangle representing the set of all children with a blue circle contained inside this rectangle. The circle represents children who deserve to live.  A subset of children among all children.   So, let's take some time to consider this set image. We know that the set of children that deserve to live is a subset of the set of all children. Our goal is to think about if there are any subsets or groups of children that should be excluded from the set of children that deserve to live, but would still be considered part of the set of all children. As an author, I have contemplated the question of if these sets were different for quite a long time, and I continue to come to the conclusion that the sets are the same.  This equivalence of sets helps give us a strategy for negation. We know that every child is in both the set of all children and the set of children that deserve to live. If we can find a single child that does not belong in the set of children that deserve to live but still belongs to the set of all children, then we can negate the statement with the claim, \"At least one child does not deserve to live.\" It seriously only takes one to negate the statement, but we know that case is not likely to exist. Another equivalent statement that is an option for a negation is the statement, \"Some children do not deserve to live.\" These two statements both claim that there are children that do not belong in the set of children that deserve to live.  Now, let's consider the statement, \"No abortion supporter deserves a vacation.\" This claim is a bit more complex, so let's start with our sets. We will lay out the sets the way that they are proposed in the statement.   A rectangle representing the set of all people. A circle contained represents people who support abortions and another disjoint circle represents people who deserve vacations.  Different subsets of people.   Notice that there is no overlap shown between the set of people that deserve vacations and the set of people that support abortions. We are starting with a diagram that matches the original claim of the statement. We use this to establish the initial truth value of the statement. Vacations tend to be labeled as something that is a privilege, but really vacations are just a break from work or school (https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/vacation). It appears that everyone deserves a vacation, so the set of all people and the set of people that deserve a vacation are equivalent sets. We also know that people that support abortion are people, who would also need a vacation. This means that the initial claim is false. Letâs think about strategies to work with the statement, so that we can approach negation. Our first step would be to update the set diagram.   A rectangle representing the set of people who deserve a vacation. Insidet his rectangle is a circle representing people who support abortion rights.  Different subsets of people.   The most clear path to a negation, which in this case is the creation of a true statement, is to use the set diagram to generate a statement. In this case it will take the form of a statement about all people that support abortion. The statement, âAll abortion supporters deserve a vacation.â would be a negation of the original statement, \"No abortion supporter deserves a vacation.\"  A more complicated version of a quantified statement is the statement, \"If abortions are not federally protected, then no one will get an abortion.\" This statement is more complicated because of the fact it is a conditional statement. When there is a conditional statement and a quantifier, we can think about combining the diagrams for two separate sets. The first set is related to the condition, and it is split between \"Abortion is federally protected,\" and \"Abortion is not federally protected.\" The set diagram provides the following base.   A rectangle split in half. The left side represents where abortion is federally protected and the right side represents where abortion is not federally protected.  Different subsets of where abortions are protected and not protected.   Now we have a secondary set to think about: people getting abortions. The question that we have to ask ourselves becomes: Will abortions still happen if abortions are not federally protected? In prior sections, we discussed that some abortions are medically necessary. There are also (while often dramatized for television, like Law and Order: SVU (see Season 12, Episode 9: âGrayâ as a specific example) scenarios where one partner in a couple will go to desperate lengths to terminate a pregnancy. A medication is administered to terminate the pregnancy. One issue that was debated during the episode was if the action of the partner was technically an abortion. The court determined that it met the legal definition of an abortion because medical means were used to terminate a pregnancy. We use this example, not only because it is widely available via the internet, but to demonstrate that abortion does not require a medical practitioner. This means that even without clinics and medical practitioners, abortions will still happen. This means that overlaying the second set gives us a diagram that looks something like the set diagram below.   A rectangle split in half. The left side represents where abortion is federally protected and the right side represents where abortion is not federally protected. On top of both regions is an overlapping rectangle representing people who get an abortion.  Different subsets of where abortions are protected and not protected along with a subset of people who get abortions.   We can see that the set of people who will get an abortion is evenly split over the two scenarios of abortion being federally protected or not being federally protected. This means that when we think about the original statement, âIf abortions are not federally protected, then no one will get an abortion,â we can see that this is a false statement as long as the set of people who will get an abortion is not an empty set. We have strong reason to believe that this set is not empty, both from the example from the Law and Order example as well as the case of medical abortions mentioned previously.  "

  "type": "Section",
  "number": "1.7",
  "title": "Arguments",
  "body": " Arguments   Typically we think about an argument as a fight between people. However, a mathematical argument is different. A mathematical argument is a collection of statements called premises and a conclusion. Below is an example of an argument: My state made it illegal to get an abortion after 6 weeks gestation. I just found out that I am pregnant and I am 8 weeks pregnant. Therefore, I cannot legally get an abortion in my state.   The premises are the first two sentences. The conclusion is the last sentence. Typically, conclusions are identified by such words as ''therefore'', ''thus'', ''hence'', etc. The goal of this section is to explain how to turn a written argument into a symbolic argument that can be evaluated using truth tables. It should be noted that we may need to be flexible with this translation and there are often many ways to interpret sentences as statements.  We begin with the last example: \"My state made it illegal to get an abortion after 6 weeks gestation. I just found out that I am pregnant and I am 8 weeks pregnant. Therefore, I cannot legally get an abortion in my state.\" We can reword this to the following: If I am more than 6 weeks pregnant, it is illegal to get an abortion in my state. I am more than 6 weeks pregnant. Therefore, it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state.   We are now ready to identify two main statements: let represent \"I am more than 6 weeks pregnant\" and let represent \"It is illegal to get an abortion in my state\".  Once we have converted the sentences into simple statements connected through our logical operations (if-then statements, and's, or's, negations), we need to address the punctuation in an argument. We do this by taking all of the premises and creating one run-on sentence. In other words, we remove every period and replace it with the word \"and\". In our example we reduce the argument to two sentences. The first sentence consists of the run-on sentence of premises. The second sentence is the conclusion of the argument. We have: If I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state and I am more than 6 weeks pregnant. Therefore, it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state. The last step needed before we convert the argument into symbolic notation is to turn these two sentences into one \"if-then\" statement. We do this in the following way: If (insert run-on sentence consisting of all premises), then (insert conclusion). We may need to be a bit flexible while reading this new one-sentence argument. In this example, it is very strange to read:  If If I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state and I am more than 6 weeks pregnant, then it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state. Instead, it is easier to read and understand the following equivalent statement:  If it is the case that if I am more than 6 weeks pregnant then it is illegal to get an abortion in my state and I am more than 6 weeks pregnant, then it is illegal for me to get an abortion in my state.   We are now ready to turn this argument into a symbolic argument. Let $q$ be âI am more than 6 weeks pregnantâ and let $p$ be âIt is illegal to get an abortion in my stateâ. We have the following symbolic argument:   We generalize this process below: Suppose an argument consists of the premises and the conclusion . The corresponding symbolic form of this argument is: Once an argument has been turned into its symbolic form, we can determine if the argument is valid and\/or sound. These concepts are addressed in the next two sections.    Valid Arguments  A mathematical argument is valid if it is always true. In other words, the final column of an argumentâs truth table will consist of only true values. For the argument presented in the previous section, we see the truth table is: making this a valid argument.    Show that the following argument is not valid. \"If access to abortion is restricted in a state, then the number of abortions in that state will decrease. The number of abortions decreased in that state. Consequently, access to abortion is restricted in that state.\"\"      Show that the following argument is valid. \"If a state restricts access to abortion, then the number of abortions will decrease in that state. The number of abortions did not decrease in that state. Therefore, the state did not restrict access to abortion.\"\"    These last two examples highlight that the validity of an argument does not depend on the actual statements being used. Instead validity focuses only on the structure of the argument. This means that an argument can be valid, but may not be sound- a concept discussed in the next example. .   Sound Arguments  A valid argument is called sound if its premises are true. If a valid argument is not sound, we say that it is unsound. In the last example, the two premises are  If a state restricts access to abortion, then the number of abortions will decrease in that state.  The number of abortions did not decrease in that state.    Both premises would need to be supported by factual data to determine if they are either true or false. However, historically it has been shown that restricting access to abortion does not reduce the number of abortions. Instead, restricting access to abortion reduces the number of safe abortions performed . Using this historical data, we could conclude that Premise 1 above is false. Thus making this argument unsound.  When a valid argument is sound, this means that the conclusion of the argument can be inferred from true statements. When a valid argument is unsound, this means the conclusion of the argument is being inferred from false statements thus making the actual argument less credible.   "

  "title": "Definitions, Assumptions, and Fallacies",
  "body": " Definitions, Assumptions, and Fallacies   As we navigate arguments there are several special language features that we need to be aware of to help us communicate clearly and effectively. These features are definitions, assumptions, and logical fallacies. These features will be discussed below.  A definition is a common meaning for a term that is held by a group. For example, if you asked various people to define the term dog, you would get similar answers from almost everyone that you asked. That is because the definition has many commonly experienced attributes such as being a pet or companion. One thing to be mindful about with definitions is that not all groups hold common definitions for the same term. One example would be the definition of abortion held by different groups. Some consider any termination of a pregnancy, no matter the reason, to be an abortion. Other groups consider abortion to be any elective termination of a pregnancy. This slight difference in how the groups define the common term can make discussions between individuals contentious.  An assumption is a sentence that is accepted in an argument as true. Some assumptions are understood, or what we call tacit assumptions. An example of a tacit assumption would be the mental image that you generate from the sentence, \"Those not yet born have been dehumanized, and so many of those born have faced increasing marginalization due to their age, ability, or perceived value\". You most likely imagine a fetus and not a robot or rock. That is because we have a tacit assumption that robots cannot be born. This sentence is part of the mission statement of the pro life advocacy group Americans United for Life   Other assumptions are stated more directly. This means that the assumptions are made explicit. When we make explicit assumptions, we speak them directly. An example of a directly spoken assumption would be the following quote,\"We see that criminalization is not as much about the behavior of the individual, but the individual itself and the identities that they hold. We know that Black and Latinx and other folks of color are more likely to be criminalized by our criminal legal system. We know the same thing is true for young people, LGBTQ folks, undocumented communities. So the risks are high for criminalization overall. We are seeing this play out in the reproductive health care space right now and it's going to get worse.\"-Jamila Perritt, MD, MPH, FACOGâPresident & CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health   This statement directly addresses that specific groups will face potentially punitive consequences when navigating the reproductive health system, if they are able to navigate it at all. Pause for a moment to think about internal and external features that might limit access to reproductive health for certain groups.  An assumption can sometimes be indicated by the presence of words like let, suppose, and assume in regular speech and writing. This particular type of language invites a listener or reader to engage with the possibilities that follow from an initial claim that is assumed to be true.It is important to be aware that not all assumptions are true. For social issues this is especially true. Assuming that certain parts of an argument are true, without proper investigation or consideration, can lead to false conclusions. One example of an assumption that can lead to false conclusions is using a non-shared definition.  For example, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines abortion as the \"termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely follow by the death of the embryo or fetus\" . However when Catherin Glenn Foster, the President and CEO of Americans United for Life was asked if an abortion occurred in the scenario of a 10-year old rape victim who became pregnant, and terminated the pregnancy, Foster replied that an abortion did not occur because âit would probably impact [the girlâs] life, and so, therefore, it would fall under any exception and would not be an abortion.â Foster later clarified that âIf a 10-year old became pregnant as a result of rape and it was threatening her life, then thatâs not an abortionâ.   A logical fallacy is a flawed, deceptive, or false argument that can be proven wrong with proper reasoning. Arguments, as we have learned, are an important part of social interactions. This is especially true when dealing with controversial topics. Logical fallacies tend to arise commonly with controversial topics because of the presence of tacit assumptions and unshared definitions. In this section, we are going to learn to identify and refute logical fallacies.  If you look online, you will see long lists of specific false arguments. It is less important to know the names of the false arguments and have memorized strategies to win arguments than it is to be able to recognize that an argument, in general, is a bad argument. Letâs look at the following case studies.    Case Study 1   In this case study, an anti-abortion blog discusses supposed fallacies and misinformation about abortion. For this specific case analysis, we are focusing on the section titled âWhat if the Baby is Deformed?â Read this section carefully, and then we will discuss the argument presented by the author.   An image of the argument from abort73.com  A snippet from the website abort73.com with the argument about when babies are deformed.    An image of the continuation of the argument from abort73.com  A snippet from the website abort73.com with the argument about when babies are deformed.     Case Study 1: The Argument  The author of the blog post makes a very decisive claim. The claim that the author is making is that: If a parent is an abortion supporter and a child is diagnosed with an disability before birth, then the parent will abort the child. If the child is diagnosed with a disability before birth and the parent aborts the child, then the parents do not support people with disabilities. Therefore, abortion supporters do not support people with disabilities. We can assign each statement in the following way:   : A parent is an abortion supporter.   : A child is diagnosed with a disability before birth.   : The parent will abort the child.   : Aboftion supporters do not support people with disabilities.  This can be represented by the following: . Use the truth table generator to determine if this is a valid argument.    Case Study 1: Discussion  It is clear that the author of the blog post does not support abortion. They also propose that supporters of abortion believe that children with disabilities that are diagnosable during pregnancy should be aborted, and therefore people that support abortion do not support members of the disabled community. One tacit assumption that the author makes is the claim that abortion is not an appropriate treatment for a physical or mental disability. The fallacy happens when the author states that making the choice to abort a child with a diagnosed disability is the same as not being a supporter of the disabled community. This type of fallacy is specifically called an equivocation because the author claims that two different things are in fact the same.    Case Study 1: Refuting the Argument  No matter which side of the argument for or against abortion you may fall on, you have an obligation to present an accurate argument. The largest flaw in the argument was the claim that mental disabilities can be diagnosed during pregnancy, which in some cases is true for genetic disorders like Downs Syndrome; however, not all mental disabilities can be diagnosed during pregnancy. One strategy to address this flaw is to look at data. If someone claims that a disability diagnosis justifies getting an abortion, we should check on data about children with disabilities. One place that might give us this information is the US Census, specifically the report on childhood disability . The report shows that nationally, from 2008 to 2019, the percentage of children that were reported as disabled increased during the time period. This is a neutral fact that participants on either side of the abortion debate can use to better defend a position. If someone is anti-abortion, then they can claim that an increase in children with disabilities means that more parents are being educated about options besides abortion and selecting those options for themselves and their unborn child. If someone is an abortion supporter, they can use the increase in children with disabilities to defend themselves against claims that they believe that unborn children with diagnosable birth defects deserve to be terminated. This is one strategy to refute this type of argument.  Another strategy is to ask specific questions that relate to why you personally have issues with the argument, and why you believe it to contain a fallacy. If you have questions about the diagnosis of mental disability during pregnancy, as an example, asking questions can help clarify meaning for both parties. You can get information about the meaning of mental disability from the other party because perhaps they have a different definition than what you have. This clarification is something that you could not have gained without having a productive discussion with another person. That is why it is a general strategy for exploring and refuting arguments.     Case Study 2   In this next case study, we examine the argument that âlife begins at conceptionâ. Many pro life groups claim that life begins at conception. One such group is Pro-Life Wisconsin . On this organizationâs webpage , they write:  An image of the argument from Pro-Life Wisconsin  A snippet from the Pro-Life Wisconsin's website.    The argument can be summarized by the following argument: Scientists agree that a human embryo is a human being immediate at conception. If you are a human being then you are alive. Thus, human life begins at conception.   : A human embryo is created immediately after fertilization.   : A human embryo is alive.  This can be represented by the following: . Use the truth table generator to determine if this is a valid argument.  We can see that this argument is valid using a truth table. However, it is not a sound argument. With no definition of âaliveâ given, this is an example of the fallacy Begging the Question, where a premise of an argument assumes the truth of the conclusion. Another example of begging the question can be found in the article, Familiar flaws in pro-life argument , published in the Montgomery Advertiser .    Case Study 2: Discussion  It turns out that trying to determine when life begins is a very difficult task particularly because there is no agreed upon definition of the word âlifeâ. Nevertheless, since the US Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion, state legislators have been trying to codify the definition of life oftentimes without input from medical professionals. The codification of âlifeâ would impact abortion rights, birth control, and assisted reproduction .  Some common definitions of beginning of life include at conception, with a heartbeat, at first breath, or the ability to live outside of a womb with the help of the latest technology . It turns out that when more technology is available, the harder this definition becomes. For example, before ultrasounds it was assumed that life began with âquickeningâ, or when the woman first felt a fetus move. However, this is often before a fetus can survive outside of a womb. Additionally, heart beats can be heard much earlier than feeling a fetus move.

However, whether a conversation is between two people with opposing views or similar views, it is important that we are mindful of how opinions can influence tacit assumptions and fallacies. It is unlikely that you will be able to change the opinions of other people, but being able to provide factual information and state sound, valid arguments that are free of fallacies will help increase awareness of the consequences of restricting or banning access to abortion. One such major consequence is the inequity of abortion access that is felt primarily by low-income individuals.  "

  "body": " Understanding the Issue   Interest and Risk   Interest  An amount of money, usually a percentage of the amount owed, which is added on to a debt which has not been paid. Usually interest is added on once a month or once a year. The percentage is called the interest rate .   Banks charge different interest rates in different situations. For example, if you already have a lot of money borrowed from other banks, a bank may charge you a higher interest rate. They do this because they are less confident that you will be able to pay the loaned money back, an idea called risk .   Risk  The probability that the amount of money a bank makes on a loan or other investment is less than the amount of money that they loaned out.   The risk of a loan is determined using a number of factors - the two most important are the borrower's credit score and whether the loan is secured or not.   Credit Score  A credit score is a number, used in the United States and a number of other countries, which assigns a number (between 300 and 850) to a person's credit risk. Higher numbers indicate lower risk.     A bar with credit scores ranging from Very Bad to Excellent. Image Description available.   \"FICO Credit Score Range\" by cafecredit is licensed with CC BY 2.0 . Image Description .   Credit scores are determined by mathematical algorithms, and are based on many different factors. We'll look at how they're determined in . The general principle of credit scores is that you are more likely to repay a loan if you have repaid other loans in the past. While this may seem like a reasonable system at face-value, it can create huge problems for people who haven't had access to loans in the past.  The other main factor that affects risk is whether the loan is secured . When you secure a loan, that means that you offer up something of value to guarantee that you will pay back the loan. If you fail to pay back the loan, the lender can reposess whatever you offered up. Large purchases - like cars or homes - are generally made on secured loans. If you fail to pay back the loan, the lending agency will take back the car or home which you borrowed the money for.    Types of Loans and Lenders   This module is primarily concerned with understanding how payday loans work. On the surface, payday loans may seem like a pretty good deal - but when carefully compared with other types of loans, we'll see that they can actually end up costing the borrower a lot of money. We'll look at how they compare to other types of loans that are available to people with better credit scores    Payday Loans    Window of a payday lender advertising loans of $50 to $500 with no credit check.   \"Payday Loan Place Window Graphics\" by taberandrew is licensed with CC BY 2.0 .   Payday loans are a type of loan often called a \"loan of last resort.\" Anyone can take out a payday loan - the lender does not check their credit score to determine risk. Therefore, the lender must assume that everyone taking out a payday loan is high risk - even though that may not be true. Payday loans are generally made for a short term, usually two weeks (the name comes from taking a loan until the next payday, when it can be paid back). At the end of the two weeks, the borrower must pay back the amount they borrowed plus a fee. Payday loans are usually for small amounts - up to $1000 - and charge a fee of $10-$30 for each $100 borrowed [ ]. So you might borrow $200 and pay it back two weeks later, plus a $30 fee. While this may not seem like much, this is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 360% - almost 20 times what a credit card might charge! In we'll see how to compute how much interest a payday loan is charging.    A short explanation of how payday lending works from the Pew Charitable Trust.     Bank Loans  Traditional bank loans are very different than a payday loan. The interest rate is determined by risk (credit score), the type of loan, and what kind of security the borrower can offer for the loan. Bank loans will have much lower interest rates than payday loans, but are not available to everyone. Many people get their first loan - when they don't have a credit history - by having someone else cosign it. A cosigner is someone, usually a parent or other relative, who agrees to pay back the loan if the borrower cannot. Student loans are an example of a type of loan that often has a cosigner - if the borrower is a student, they may not have the credit history or security to borrow on their own.  One popular type of bank loan, used by many consumers, is the credit card. A credit card is effectively an agreement between the bank and the cardholder to loan any amount of money on a short-term basis, up to a certain amount - called the credit limit . The cardholder agrees to pay back at least the interest on the loan each month, or pay a penalty. If the cardholder doesn't make their minimum payment each month, in addition to the penalty fees, the bank can cancel the credit card. Falling behind on paying a credit card can quickly add up - both in fees and in damage to your credit rating. If you have a high credit score, banks will usually agree to give you a credit card with a low interest rate. If your credit score isn't as good, though, they will either deny you a card entirely, offer you one with a high interest rate, or require you to secure the card (pay a deposit to cover any missed payments).  Many people take out bank loans to make major purchases, like homes or cars. A mortgage is a bank loan which uses a home or piece of property as a security. Many people use a mortgage to borrow money to buy a home. If they fail to repay the loan, the bank gets to take the security - in this case, their home. When the bank takes the security from the loan, it is called a foreclosure (usually used with homes and property) or a reposession (usually used with vehicles like cars or boats). The result is the same - the bank takes the property which was used to secure the loan. They are then able to sell that property to earn back the money that they loaned out. Interest rates for these types of loans tend to be much lower, because the opportunity to foreclose on the property gives the bank a way to earn their money back even if the borrower does not repay the loan.    Government Loans  The government - both state and federal governments in the US - is also an important provider of loans. These loans are either provided directly by the government or secured by the government (a private bank makes the loan, and the government provides the security for the borrower). In some cases - like subsidized student loans - the government may even pay part of the interest. Government loans provide access to money for people in need, but the process for getting one can be complicated and take time. In addition, many government loans are restricted to particular groups, like veterans, small businesses, or first-time college students.  Some government loans can be forgiven , meaning that the government does not require the loan to be paid back in exchange for some form of service from the borrower. For example, government student loans can be forgiven after ten years of work in public service, as long as certain requirements are met.    Pawn  A pawn is a short-term secured loan, usually made to someone with a low or no credit score. In a pawn, the borrower brings a valuable object (usually something small, like jewelry or electronics) to a pawn shop. The pawnbroker pays them some percentage of the value of the item, generally less than half. The borrower must then repay the amount, plus interest. If the borrower doesn't pay the money back, the pawnbroker can sell their item to recoup their investment.  Pawns generally offer more favorable interest rates than payday loans, since the loan is secured. However, the borrower loses the ability to use whatever they have pawned while the money is borrowed. For something like jewelry, that can mean living with the anxiety of losing a valuable or sentimental item. For something like electronics, it could impact their ability to communicate or work.     Discriminatory Lending  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is a federal law in the United States which prohibits discrimination in the loaning of money and other credit transactions . The ECOA prohibits discrimination on the basis of  Race or color;  Religion;  National origin;  Sex;  Marital Status;  Age;  Source of income;  Excercise of consumer credit rights.    So if the ECOA exists, banks are unable to discriminate against different types of people, right? Unfortunately, no. While the ECOA makes it illegal to discriminate in mortgage lending, enforcement of the law is very challenging. It is very difficult to prove, in a situation where so many different factors are involved, that race or national origin influenced the lenders decision. Many lenders use complex computer algorithms to decide whether to lend to a particular borrower. Frequently, these algorithms are trained in a process called machine learning , where the computer studies data from past loans. The computer finds patterns in the data, and uses those patterns to make decision about whether to lend and what terms to offer. Because that data is based on past lending decisions made by human beings, it can (and does) contain biased decisions made by those human beings. Research has shown that these algorithms replicate the patterns of racial and ethnic discrimination that were made in the data they are trained on. Therefore, although overt discrimination is forbidden in lending, it still occurs.  In addition to the discrimination that occurs through implicit bias (both in humans and in algorithms), the ECOA, and other similar laws in different countries, still allow banks and other lenders to discriminate on the basis of risk. Banks can choose whether or not they want to lend someone money based on how likely that person is to pay it back.  We've talked about how banks, the government, and other entities make decisions about who they will loan money to. Those decisions are made primarily on the basis of two things: credit history and access to security. If someone has a strong credit history - they have borrowed money and paid it back on time - or if they have access to property or someone with credit history to secure their loan - then they can obtain favorable terms for a loan. If they do not have either of those things, then they are left to borrow money from lenders who demand much higher interest payments.  This brings us to the question, then, of which groups of people have access to those things. Although the ECOA banned discrimination in the loaning of money in 1974, access to credit tends to be passed down through generations. If your grandparents did not have access to credit, they may not have been able to support your parents when they needed to borrow money for education or a first home - in which case, your parents would be unable to offer the same opportunities to you.  Thus, the question of who has access to affordable credit can become a question of who has access to generational wealth. Wealth is defined as the value of a family's assets - both money saved in bank accounts and investments as well as property like homes and cars - minus their debt. Studies have shown that Black Americans (as well as other people of color) have far less wealth than white Americans. In 2016, a study found that the median wealth of Black households was less than 10% of that of similar white households . Wealth tends to accumulate in families over time. This can be direct, like inheritance, where one generation receives wealth (money or property) directly from the previous one. It can also be indirect. For example, a college student may indirectly inherit generational wealth when their parents pay for part or all of their college, or when they win a scholarship from opportunities provided by their parents. This allows them to avoid taking on debt to pay for college, which would decrease their overall wealth. This accumulated wealth, then, gives them greater opportunities to credit in their future. The effect of generational wealth can be seen in the paradoxical relationship between wealth and debt in America. Even though they have 10 times the median wealth, white households have median debt which is more than twice as high as Black households . The debt held by white households, though, tends to be less costly than that held by Black households. Much of this discrepancy is due to access to cheaper forms of debt like home mortgages, home equity loans, and student loans. Black households tend to hold more of their debt in more expensive forms of credit like credit card debt and installment loans.  On the surface, payday loans are available to anyone. Because wealthier and white households tend to have access to other forms of credit, payday loans tend to be used primarily by poorer households and people of color. People who do not own their own home are 57% more likely to use payday loans than homeowners. People without a 4-year college degree are 82% more likely to use payday loans than those with degrees. Race, though, was the greatest predictor of whether someone had used a payday loan - Blacks were more than twice as likely (105% more likely) to have used a payday loan as individuals of other races and ethnicities, even after controlling for other factors like income level and homeownership . If access to credit were only determined by risk - factors like income and access to security - we could expect the percentage of white and Black borrowers to be similar.  In addition to the obstacles imposed by lending discrimination and lack of generational wealth, there are other reasons why people would turn to predatory forms of lending. One very simple reason is where they live.  A study in 2019 found that there are simply fewer banks in majority Black neighborhoods. In areas where the majority of residents were white, there was an average of 41 banks & other financial institutions per 100,000 people. In majority non-white neighborhoods, that number fell to 27 per 100,000. Furthermore, banks in majority Black neighborhoods tended to charge higher fees than those in majority white neighborhoods .  The lack of banks in majority Black neighborhoods is mirrored by a greater concentration of payday lenders. A 2016 study in California found that the neighborhoods where payday lenders were concentrated were much more likely to be majority Black or Latinx . A 2020 survey found that Black respondents were more than twice as likely to say that they lived within one mile of a payday lender . This lack of access to low-interest lenders, coupled with easy access to high-interest lenders, is called reverse redlining . Redlining was the (now illegal) practice of singling out minority neighborhoods for mortgage discrimination, denying loans to people buying homes in those neighborhoods. Redlining is considered a major contributor to the generational wealth gap between Black and white americans. Similarly, reverse redlining creates neighborhoods without access to low-interest credit - not because of bank policies, per se, but because of physical proximity to lending institutions.    We've learned a lot about payday lenders - how they operate, why people use them, where they are, and what they do. Now that we understand the sociological aspects of the issue, let's dive into the mathematics. Mathematics can help us understand just how unfair payday lending is, how these lenders turn a profit, and study the inequity in where payday lenders are located. We'll learn the mathematics we need to analyze these issues, and then dive into some deeper exploration of the inequity of payday lending.   "

We'll discuss the different possible ways that companies can mislead consumers about the cost of their products.  We'll look at the concept of risk and expected value.

Then we'll see how we can use this mathematics to look at payday loans.    Simple Interest  Mathematically, interest is computed by taking a percentage of the principal. We can think about interest from two perspectives. From the perspective of the bank or the person loaning the money, they are making an investment - they give someone a certain amount of money, with the expectation that they will be paid back more money in the future. From the perspective of the borrower, this money (or the object that they bought with it, like a house or a car) is a loan - they will repay more back in the future than what they borrowed.

Simple Interest  If you invest a principle at an APR (written as a decimal) for a given number of years, the investment will now be worth:   This can also be written, using variables, as   Here, is the amount the investment is worth, is the principle, is the APR (written as a decimal), and is the amount of time that the loan is made for.   Simple interest is usually used for transactions between friends and family or for certain types of loans, like automobile purchases. It is used because it is easy to calculate and understand.  Here are some examples for you to try:    Susan's parents loan them $1000 to help them move into a new apartment. They ask that Susan pay the money back in 2 years with 4% simple interest. How much will they owe?    4%, written as a decimal, is . So using the formula above, we get that Susan owes their parents       Fernando purchases a $20,000 car.

First compute how much Fernando owes total. How many monthly payments will there be?    The total amount that Fernando owes is:   Since they are paying off the debt over 5 years, they will make monthly payments. Assuming that all of the monthly payments are the same, Fernando will need to pay       Compound Interest  Most lenders actually use a different way of calculating interest, called compound interest . In compound interest, rather than just taking a percentage of the amount once, interest is calculated regularly - every day, month, year, or some other unit of time. This causes interest to accumulate more rapidly, since you are taking a percentage not just of the original amount, but also of any interest that has already been added on.  For example, imagine you borrow $100 at 5% interest for 10 years. With simple interest, you would add 5% of $100 - $5 - each year for 10 years, for a total of $50 worth of interest. You would end up owing $150 after 10 years. If you were paying 5% interest compounded annually , though, you would take 5% of the amount each year - including any interest that has already accumulated.   5% interest compounded annually.    Year  Total Amount Owed with Interest    0  100    1  105 = 100 + 100*0.05    2  110.25 = 105 + 105*0.05    3  115.76 = 110.25 + 110.25*0.05    4  121.55 = 115.76 + 115.76*0.05    5  127.63 = 121.55 + 121.55*0.05    6  134.01 = 127.63 + 127.63*0.05    7  140.71 = 134.01 + 134.01*0.05    8  147.75 = 140.71 + 140.71*0.05    9  155.13 = 147.75 + 147.75*0.05    10  162.89 = 155.13 + 155.13*0.05     If we were using simple interest to calculate the amount owed here, after 10 years, we would owe The additional $12.89 is interest which is being paid on the interest!  $12 may not seem like that big of a deal (although it can be, for people who are really struggling), but compound interest adds up much faster when the amount borrowed or the interest rate is larger. Even a small increase in the interest rate can have a huge effect on the amount owed at the end of the loan.  Creating this table isn't hard, but it is time-consuming. One of the most important parts of mathematics is looking for patterns in numbers that we can use to save time. In this formula, we can see that each time we take the previous amount and add 0.05 times that amount:    Notice that this is the same thing as multiplying the previous amount by 1.05    Multiplying by the same amount at every step gets us an exponential relationship. We have     All together, this suggests a faster way to get any of the values in the table above, by using an exponential equation. After n years, we will owe dollars. This gives us an equation for the amount of money owed when interest is computed annually.  In general, though, lenders can charge interest as often as they like. Interest is frequently compounded monthly (12 times a year) or daily (365 times a year). In these cases, we use basically the same formula - with two main changes.  If you pay 12% interest over the year, but you're being charged interest each month, you wouldn't pay 12% interest every month! Instead, we divide the interest rate by the number of times we compound each year. 12% annual interest would become monthly interest. If we were compounding daily, we would have daily interest.  We also need to increase the power on our exponent. If you compute interest every month for 10 years, you're computing interest 12*10 = 120 times overall. If you're compounding daily, you would have 365*10 = 3650 times overall.  Making these two changes gives us our formula for Compound Interest.   Compound Interest  If you invest a principle at an APR (written as a decimal) for a given number of years, compounded times per year, the investment will now be worth:   This can also be written, using variables, as   Here, is the amount the investment is worth, is the principle, is the APR (written as a decimal), is the number of times interest is compounded each year, and is the amount of time that the loan is made for.   This exponential growth is what makes a small change to the interest rate such a big deal. Let's look at two loans - both for $1000, compounded monthly, over a period of 10 years. One lender charges an APR of 4%, while the other lender charges 7%. Let's see how much you owe at the end of 10 years using each formula:  Even though 7% is only a small amount large than 4%, it makes a huge difference - over $500 - in how much you owe at the end of the loan. Increasing the loan to 10% makes an even bigger difference:  Here are some examples for you to try:   Tasha borrows $2000 at 14% interest, compounded monthly. How much will they owe in a year?    We can tell this is compound interest because it says compounded. Figure out which numbers go where in the formula.    Tasha will owe       Diego borrowed money at a 15% interest rate for 5 years, compounded daily. If they had to pay back $3000, how much did they borrow originally?    In this example, what are we looking for? Put everything else into the compound interest formula and solve for the missing variable.    We know what Diego has to pay back (A in the formula), but we don't know what he borrowed in the first place (P in the formula). So we have:   Diego only borrowed $1417.32 at the beginning of the 5 years. They paid back over twice as much as they borrowed.      Finding the Interest Rate  One of the ways that payday lenders conceal how much interest they're charging is by charging a \"fee\" instead of an interest rate. For example, a payday lender may loan someone $200 for two weeks. When they pay the money back, they charge them a $20 fee.  In this example, $20 may not seem like a lot - it's only 10% of the $200 that they borrowed. Remember, though, that when we talk about interest rates, we talk about annual percentage rates. This is 10% over two weeks - if you don't pay the $20 at the end of the first two weeks, you'll be charged another $20 at the end of the next two weeks! There are 52 weeks in the year, so by the end of the year (26 two-week periods) you would have paid in interest - that's of the amount you borrowed! The annual percentage rate is 260%!  Notice that this is simple interest - the amount of interest that they charge you each time didn't change (it was $20 every two weeks). Most payday lenders work this way - every two weeks you pay the fee until you can pay back the original money you borrowed. The fees vary, but are usually between $10 and $30 per $100 borrowed every two weeks.  You can use the simple interest formula to figure out what the equivalent annual interest rate is. Remember that when you use the formula, the time is always in years, so 2 weeks would equal of a year. Say you borrow $300 and pay a $25 fee per $100 for every two weeks. You'll owe at the end of the two weeks, so the simple interest formula gives you:    The equivalent annual percentage rate is 650%.  How much would you owe after two weeks if you borrowed the same money on a credit card which charges 22% interest, compounded daily? Here we use the compound interest formula. Even though 22% is a pretty high interest rate for a credit card, you'll still end up paying a lot less than the payday loan:   At 22%, compounded daily, you end up just paying $2.55 in interest after 2 weeks.

  "title": "Risk and Credit Scores",
  "body": " Risk and Credit Scores   When we talked about lending in the introduction, we discussed the credit score . Your credit score is a number - usually between 300 and 850 in the United States - which tells a lender how likely you are to repay borrowed money. We can think of a credit score in terms of probability.    Introduction to Probability  The probability of a particular event occurring is a number between 0 and 1 (or, equivalently, between 0% and 100%) which measures how likely that event is to occur. If something has a probability of 0, that means it will never happen. If it has a probability of 1, then it will always happen, no matter what.  Usually, when we study probability, we talk about simple situations where it's easy to determine the probability. For example, if you roll a 6-sided die, the probability that you get a 6 is because you're looking at 1 possibility out of 6 total.  However, in the real world, probabilities are usually much more complicated to determine. To calculate your credit score, credit reporting agencies use many different factors - how long you've had loans or credit cards, how many times you have been late paying your bills, and the types of loans and credit cards that you have. There is no simple formula to calculate how likely you are to repay a loan. The credit score summarizes the complicated calculations that have gone into determining the likelihood of you paying back money that you borrow.  Although it is an oversimplification of the actual situation, we'll use the credit score as a simple measure of probability so that we can see an example of how it works. We'll treat a score of 300 - the lowest score - as meaning that the probability you pay back a loan is 0%. We'll say that a credit score of 850 means that there is a 100% chance that you pay back the loan on time. We'll treat every score between as a number between 0 and 100% using the formula So a credit score of 700, in our simplification would mean a chance of repaying the loan on time.    Expected Value  Once banks determine how likely you are to repay a loan, they can make a decision about whether they will loan you money, whether that's as a student loan, credit card, or something else. They use the credit score to determine the amount of money they can expect to make off of the loan. If you don't repay the loan, they will lose all of the money that they loaned you. If you do repay the loan, then they make money - in the form of the interest that you pay back on the loan. This is called the expected value of the loan. It depends on both the probability that a borrower will pay back the loan, the amount of money being borrowed, and the amount of interest that the bank will make off of the loan.  Before we look at the expected value of a loan, let's define the expected value in general. Expected value works by using the probability to weight the reward of different events happening. Consider this example: Say a friend makes you an offer. They'll flip a coin. If the coin comes up heads, they'll pay you $1. If the coin comes up tails, you pay them $1.  If you play the game just once, you'll end up either $1 richer or $1 poorer - there's a 50% chance of either. If you play it twice, you either win both, win the first and lose the second, lose the first and win the second, or lose both - so there are 4 possibilities. If you win both times, you're $2 richer. If you win one and lose one (either of the middle two situations) you're back where you started - $0 richer. If you lose both, you're $2 poorer. If you average out the different scenarios, you end up exactly where you started - there's exactly the same chance of winning money as losing. So we say the expected value is $0 - on average, we don't expect to end up with any more money than we started with.  Expected value depends on probability - so it certainly isn't saying that if you play that game with your friend, you won't win any money! You could play 10 times and win every time...it just isn't very likely (the chance of that happening is a little less than 1\/1000)   Expected Value  Suppose you have multiple different possible events, each with some probability of occurring, and each with some \"reward\" our \"benefit\" (penalties or losses are represented as negative rewards). Then the expected value is found by taking the probability of each event times the reward of that event, and adding them up: where P(event) is the probability of the event, and R(event) is the reward. You can continue this for more than 2 events - just multiply the probability times the reward and add it on.  The expected value tells you, on average, how much you can expect to \"win\" each time an event happens, by averaging out the wins and losses.   Let's look at an example of how this works, using insurance as an example. When an insurance company sells you insurance, they calculate the probability that you will use it - and how much they'll have to pay you if you do use it. If you don't use the insurance, they \"win\" the amount of money that you pay for the insurance - if you do use it, they lose whatever they have to pay out for the claim (minus whatever you paid them). On average, over lots and lots of customers, they'll earn the expected value from each customer. Let's look at an example.  An insurance company calculates that there is a 1% chance that a driver has a car accident each year, and that on average they will have to pay $15,000 per accident. They charge $600 a year for insurance. How much can they expect to earn, on average, from each customer?  The probability of having an accident is 1% (0.01), which means that the probability of not having an accident is 99% (0.99). If you have an accident, the insurance company loses $15,000, minus the $600 you paid them, for a net \"reward\" of . If you don't have an accident, they earn a \"reward\" of $600 - the amount you paid for your insurance. The expected value, then is: On average, they can expect to earn $450 per customer that they sell insurance to.  Give it a try yourself - here are some examples to work out.    An insurance company charges $2000 a year for home insurance. There is a 2% chance each year that a homeowner will make a claim, and the insurance company will need to pay them $23,000. What is the expected value?    What is the probability that they have to pay money out? How much will they lose if they do (remember they get to keep the money that was paid for the insurance policy)?    The probability that they will have to pay is 2% = 0.02. If they do have to pay, they will lose $23,000 minus the $2000 they charged the customer, for a total of $21,000. There is a 98% = 0.98 chance that they don't have to pay, in which case they'll earn $2000 from the customer's premium. The expected value for the insurance company is On average, they can expect to earn $1540 per customer.    Let's look at example explicitly about how payday lenders operate. Most payday lenders make their money because people renew their loans week after week, paying larger fees to borrow the money for a longer period of time.    A payday lender loans you $200 with a $30 fee, to be paid back in 2 weeks. If you don't pay it back in 2 weeks, you'll be charged another $30 fee, and another $30 for each 2 weeks after that. They think that there is a 10% chance you'll pay it back in 2 weeks, a 20% chance you'll pay it back in 4 weeks, a 60% chance you'll pay it back in 6 weeks, and a 10% chance you won't pay it back at all. What is the expected value of the loan for the lender?    Think about how much the payday lender earns (or loses) in each case.    There are 4 different situations here. If you pay the loan back in 2 weeks (10% chance), the lender earns $30. If you pay it back in 4 weeks (20% chance), they earn $60. If you pay it back in 6 weeks (60% chance), they earn $90. If you don't pay it back (10% chance), they lose $200. The expected value is On average, they can expect to earn $49 per customer.      How Banks Make Lending Decisions  Banks use the idea of risk to make decisions about how much money they will lend. We'll look at a simplified example of how this works, though the reality is, of course, more complicated. This will still give you an idea, fundamentally of how it works.  Say that you want to borrow $1000 from a bank via an unsecured loan. If the loan were secured, and you didn't pay it back, the bank could seize your house or car or whatever you had secured the loan with. Since it's unsecured, the bank will lose all of the money that they loaned you if you don't pay it back. Therefore, they want to make the expected value of loaning you money positive (for them) - that is, they want to ensure that on average the money that you pay them in interest makes up for the risk of you not paying the loan back.  Let's look at the situation where the bank loans you $1000 for 1 year, simple interest, and let's assume that they decide there's a 10% chance you don't pay the loan off. If the interest rate is r , the expected value calculations look like this:  Expected Value for a $1000 loan for 1 year with 10% risk of default    Rate (r)  Amount of Interest  Expected Value    0.02  $20     0.03  $30     0.04  $40     0.05  $50     0.06  $60     0.07  $70     0.08  $80     0.09  $90     0.10  $100     0.11  $110     0.12  $120     The bank would need to charge at least 12% interest to be guaranteed to make money. In practice, a bank would charge considerably more interest for an unsecured loan if there were such a large chance they would get none of the money back - if they would loan it at all. If you don't pay back your loan, your bank will sell the debt to a debt collector - who will pay them what they think the loan is worth, usually a fraction of the loan. The debt collector will then attempt to get the money back through legal actions like lawsuits and garnished wages.    You apply for a loan of $10,000 from a bank. They compute that there is a 1% chance that you won't pay the loan back, in which case they'll sell it to a debt collector for $5000. What is the expected value for the bank if they charge you 4.25% interest, simple interest, and you pay the loan back in 2 years?    What does the bank gain if you pay the loan back? What do they lose if you don't?    There are 2 different situations here - either you don't pay the loan back in 2 years, or you do. If you don't (1% chance), then the bank loses $5000 (they loaned you $10,000, and the debt collector only paid them $5,000). If you do pay it back (99% chance), then the bank gains the interest you paid back. After 2 years of 4.25% simple interest, you pay the bank back The bank earned $850 (they loaned you $10,000, and got $10,850 back). The expected value for the bank is If they made many loans like this, on average, they would earn $791.50 per customer.    Let's do a more complicated example, with compound interest.    The bank is considering loaning you $5,000, at a rate of 8.75%, compounded monthly, to be paid back after 3 years. They calculate that there is a 2% chance you won't pay the loan back, and they'll have to sell the debt to a debt collector for $3000. What is the expected value for the bank?    Figure out how much the bank will earn on the loan if you pay it back in full, with interest, after 3 years.    If you pay the loan back, you'll pay the bank This is $1494.69 more than the bank loaned you, so in this situation, they \"win\" $1494.69. If you don't pay the loan back, they lose $2000, because they can only sell the loan to a debt collector for $3000. Thus, the expected value is: The bank can expect to earn, on average, $1424.80 on each loan like this.     "

  "title": "Correlation",
  "body": " Correlation   Our final mathematical topic for this module will be correlation. When we looked at the background of payday lenders, we talked about the fact that they are more likely to be located in majority Black and Latinx neighborhoods. We'll look at analyzing this mathematically through the lens of correlation.    Defining the Correlation  Suppose we have two sets of numbers:  If someone told you that the next number in the first set was 30, what would you expect the next number in the second set to be? You would probably guess 60, because there's a clear pattern here - the number in the second series is always exactly double the corresponding number in the first series.  In practice, when we look at two sets of data, the relationship between them is rarely this exact. For example, look at these two sets of data:  The values in the second set are just a little bit off from two times as much as the first set. If someone told you the next number in the first set was 30, though, you would still probably expect the next number in the second set to be approximately 60 - maybe not exactly 60, but something close. Even though one number doesn't exactly predict the other, it comes pretty close.  The correlation is a way of measuring how closely one set of numbers predict another. The correlation gives a number between 1 and -1. A correlation of 0 means that there is absolutely no relationship between the two sets of numbers - when one changes, you can't predict what will happen to the other. A correlation of 1 means that there is a perfect relationship between the numbers - when the values in the first data set increase, the values in the second data set increases in a way that exactly corresponds. Our first two sets of numbers would have a correlation of 1. Our second pair would have a correlation close to 1, but not exactly 1. A correlation of -1 also indicates a perfect relationship, but when one of the values in one set increases, the values in the second set will decrease in a way that exactly corresponds. So the pattern is still perfect, but it works in reverse.  Computing the correlation is tricky. We'll go through the process of computing it, which takes multiple steps, but in general we'll do it using software. The R programming language lets us easily find the correlation between two sets of numbers. Here, you'll see the two data sets we looked at above. The cor function in R calculates the correlation between two sets of numbers - hit \"Evaluate R\" to calculate. You can try different values in the exercise below - just hit \"Evaluate R\" to find the correlation. You'll see that when we look at the first pair of data sets, the correlation is exactly 1: If we look at the second pair, though, the correlation is a little less than 1. 0.9812022 is still very close to 1, though, because these numbers still mostly fit the pattern - just not perfectly.  If we have numbers that are completely unrelated, though - where there is no pattern between how much one increases by and the other - we'll see very low correlation:     Computing Correlation  Computing the correlation is a little complicated, and is easiest done in multiple steps. While it's not crucial that you can go through all of these steps on your own, we'll explain how the correlation is defined to help understand why it computes how related two sets of data are.   Correlation  If we have two sets of data and with the same number of values, the correlation is where and are the means of and , and and are the sample standard deviations of and .  You can compute the mean by adding up all the values and dividing by .   You can compute the sample standard deviation by subtracting the mean from each value, squaring that, adding them all up, dividing by , and taking the square root.    This is a pretty complicated formula, but it turns out it's pretty easy to break it down into steps.  Compute the means and .  Compute the sample standard deviations and .  Subtract the mean from each value in , and the mean from each value in .  Multiply the corresponding differences from and together.  Add them all up.  Divide the whole thing by .    Let's see how this works with the second data set above:    First we'll compute the means and sample standard deviations of each data set:      Now that we have all of these, let's get down to the work of calculating the correlation. Our next step is to subtract the mean from each data value in and :    Now we'll multiply each corresponding pair together:   Now we'll add up all the values:   And finally, we divide by .   This is the same value we got from R above, up to 3 decimal places (the difference comes because we rounded and )    Using Correlation  Ok, so we've defined this correlation, which tells us how one set of numbers is related to another. But why does it matter?  An old adage says that \"correlation does not imply causation,\" meaning that just because two things are correlated doesn't mean that change to one causes the change in another. Two things could be correlated that are completely unrelated. For example, there is a strong correlation (0.9039) between the number of bee colonies in the US and the divorce rate in South Carolina:    The number of honey-producing bee colonies in the US correlates with the divorce rate in South Carolina   Does this mean that bees are breaking up marriages in South Carolina, or that new divorcees are running out to start beekeeping? Of course not (or at least, probably not). We don't have any other reason to believe that one of these variables is causing the other. But when there is some reason why we might believe that one thing is causing another, the correlation can give us evidence to support that theory.    Correlation does not imply causation.   For example, because of the legacy of systemic racism and intentional exclusion of Black Americans from the financial system, we could theorize that there are fewer banks - and more payday lenders - in majority Black neighborhoods. We could use correlation to see if there is evidence for this theory - by looking at the racial makeup of a neighborhood and seeing if there is a correlation with the number of financial institutions. This doesn't prove that banks are intentionally avoiding Black neighborhoods (though other evidence may support that claim) - it just provides evidence to support that theory.   "

  "body": " Solving for Change   Now that we understand interest rates, risk, and correlation, we can begin to really look at the problem of predatory lending. The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) tracks payday lending across the country. Using a $300 loan, they calculated the annual percentage rate that you would pay in interest in each state of the United States. Note that some of the states have no rate listed - those states have passed laws which make predatory lending unprofitable.    Map of the United States with typical payday loan APR. Image description available.   Payday lending rates by state. States with no percentage listed have passed laws effectively outlawing predatory payday lending, usually by banning interest rates over a particular level (Minnesota's ban goes into effect on 1\/1\/2024). Calculations are based on a $400 loan in June 2023. Image adapted from work by Spitfire19, CC BY 1.0 , via Wikimedia Commons. The adapted image is by Mark Branson CC BY-NC 4.0 . Data from . Image Description .   All of these rates are unfair and predatory, but some of them are appalling. In Texas, payday lenders charge up to 664% interest on a $300 loan - that means that over the course of a year, if you borrow $300, you end up paying back   That's $1,992 in interest on a $300 loan - about $75 every two weeks. Payday lenders tend to break their loans down into smaller amounts in order to make it seem like less. Rather than saying $1,992 in interest every year, or even $75 every two weeks on a $300 loan, they would say, \"Our fee is $25 for every $100 you borrow, paid back after two weeks.\" If that 2 weeks ends, and you can't re-pay the loan...another $25 for every $100 is charged. For a borrower struggling to make ends meet, the fees add up like clockwork.  Lenders make many arguments about why they should be able to charge these rates. Sometimes they say that because people are willing to pay their rates, they should be able to charge them - if it were too much, no one would pay them. They say that they have to charge such high interest rates because the risk of default - a borrower not paying back their loan - is so high. And they make the argument that if they didn't lend money to these people, no one else would.  All of these arguments have some merit, and if we want to fight predatory lending, we need to learn to make counter-arguments. This is where our newly learned mathematical skills come into play.    If people are willing to pay...  The first argument for payday lending says, basically, that if people are willing to pay for a payday loan, then it should be legal to offer them. This is a free market argument - essentially saying that if the fees were too much, the market wouldn't support them.  There is definitely something to this argument - in Texas, for example, in 2021, there is no cap on the interest that can be charged for a payday loan, but as we saw above, the average rate is 664%. This is essentially letting the market choose the rate - lenders have stopped at this point because no one will pay rates higher.  The people who borrow loans at these ultra-high interest rates, though, don't do it because they have plenty of money to throw around. They do it because they have no other choice. We can see this by looking at the correlation between the number of payday lenders and where people live.   shows data, taken from the 2012 American Community Survey (part of the Census) on the 20 largest counties in Alabama. For each, we have the number of 522390 establishments (a category which includes payday lenders and related businesses which provide financial services outside of the traditional banking sector), the percentage of the population which is white, the percentage of the population which is Black, and the median household income.      County  Number of Payday Lenders  Percent White  Percent Black  Median Household Income    Baldwin County  16  86.3  8.8  48378    Calhoun County  15  75.6  21.4  39169    Cullman County  6  96.4  1.1  37287    DeKalb County  6  94  0.8  38445    Elmore County  10  75.9  20.9  53328    Etowah County  10  81.3  15  34264    Houston County  14  70.2  26.5  40409    Jefferson County  82  53.2  42.6  43959    Lauderdale County  9  87.2  10  41908    Lee County  14  70.2  22.8  45043    Limestone County  5  80.7  12.5  47999    Madison County  23  69.2  24.5  56839    Marshall County  9  90.6  2.1  36197    Mobile County  51  60.6  35.1  39691    Montgomery County  33  39.6  55.3  41807    Morgan County  9  82.2  11.8  45051    St. Clair County  8  87.7  9.2  51859    Shelby County  15  81.1  11.2  65728    Talladega County  9  64.2  34  31547    Tuscaloosa County  17  67  30.4  41139      We can look at the correlations between these different data sets. For example, the R code below calculates the correlation between the number of payday lenders and the white population of a county, which is -0.68.   This means that there is a negative correlation between the percentage of a county which is white and the number of payday lenders - that is, the more white people live in a county, the fewer payday lenders will you find. Because Alabama is largely a biracial state (with non-white and non-Black minority populations making up a very small percentage of the population), we see a similar (but reversed) correlation between Black population and payday lenders of 0.67 - so more Black people in a county corresponds to more payday lenders. The R code to calculate that correlation is next.   When we see a correlation like this, as we discussed before, we need to remember that it's not proof of a cause - just evidence. One thing we should always be thinking about is the possibility of confounding . Confounding is when another factor we're not thinking about causes a change in our data. For example, here, poverty could be a confounding factor. Because of the deep legacy of racial inequality in the United States, Black people are more likely to live in poverty. Could the correlation between counties with higher Black populations and payday lenders actually be because those counties are poorer? Let's look and see if there is a correlation between median income and the number of payday lenders.   The correlation here is 0.02, extremely close to 0. Remember that a correlation of 0 means that there is no relationship between the two data sets - that when one increases, the other is equally likely to increase or decrease. So median income doesn't predict the number of payday lenders nearly as well as race.  In the exercises, we'll consider another possible confounding factor - population. Is it possible that the counties with larger Black populations just have more people, and thus more payday lenders?    We have to charge those rates, because of the risk!  The second argument made for why payday loans are \"fair\" is that the lenders are taking a large risk by making the loans - so they should be entitled to charge high interest rates. One question here - which we won't focus on - is whether it is fair to charge interest at all, or if our society should have a more effective way of providing capital to those who lack it. Kiva is a non-profit organization that provides loans without interest worldwide, for example. But even working within the existing framework of capitalism, where any money borrowed must be repaid with interest, we can ask the question of what level of interest is fair.  Let's look at how much money payday lenders are making on loans, through the lens of expected value. In 2015, the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) found that 46% of all payday loan borrowers defaulted on their loans within two years . A default on a loan occurs when the lender is unable to meet the terms of the loan. While this doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't pay the loan back (in fact, the CRL found that 66% of those defaulting eventually paid their loans back in full, plus any fees that they would have paid for defaulting, like late fees), it does mean that the lender is losing some money on the investment. The same study found that 20% of loans are charged off within two years, meaning that the lender gives up on collecting the debt. Again, this doesn't mean they lose all of their money, since the loans are then usually sold to a debt collector who tries to collect some or all of the money, but they do lose much of their investment in this case.  Obviously, these situations are very complicated, and there are a lot of possible results, so as we did before, we'll consider a simplified version.  Let's assume that 20% of the time, the lender loses everything (the loan is charged off). 26% of the time (in the other defaults), they get paid back the full value of the loan, plus the interest, plus late fees. In the remaining 54% of cases, the lender pays back the loan in full.  In a 2014 report, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that the median payday loan sequence is repaid after one month . So in our scenario above, there are 3 possibilities - 20% of the time, the lender loses everything; 26% of the time, they get back the loan, plus the interest and late fees; and 54% of the time they get their loan back plus interest.  Let's say someone borrows $300 for one month in California at a 460% interest rate. The late fee for a defaulting lender is $25. How much money should the payday lender expect to make off of them?  First we need to calculate the interest paid, using the simple interest formula: The borrower ends up paying $415 total, or $115 in interest.  Now we can calculate expected value. We take each probability and multiply it times the amount that the lender earns (or a negative value, if they lose money). Then we add them up. On average, the lender earns $38.50 on the $300 loan.  Of course, many borrowers end up renewing their loans for much more than a month. Unlike a borrower who pays back their loan quickly, who may just have a temporary emergency need for money, these borrowers struggle to ever pay back their loan, racking up more fees each time they renew the loan.  What if we look at the exact same scenario, but the borrower borrows the money for a year? Then they will pay back a total of The borrower ends up paying $1,680 total, so $1,380 in interest. If they default on the loan, they also end up paying late fee (possibly more than one, but let's assume just one). We can calculate the expected value for the payday lender: For every borrower that pays their loan back after a year of fees, on average, the lender can expect to earn $1050.50! This illustrates the fundamental mechanic of payday lending - the lenders make more money if they lend to borrowers who can just barely afford to pay the loan back. They have a vested interest in lending to people who are struggling to get by instead of those who are dealing with an unexpected emergency.    If we don't lend to them, who will?  This point, of all those made, is the most salient. Payday lenders exist because for many people with poor credit, there are no other options. If a borrower has something of value to pawn, they could use a pawn broker - but for people struggling to get by, things of value may be too precious to pawn (the computer that a student uses for school; heirloom jewelry; the car used to get to work).  However, as compelling as this argument might be, it turns out to be false. Many states have banned payday lending, usually by setting a cap of 36% on annual interest rates. While this cap may seem high when compared to interest rates on credit cards and other types of loans, it is generally low enough to make payday lending untenable. In 2017, the Center for Responsible Lending studied states which have passed these kinds of bans, and found that banning payday loans did not significantly impact borrowers' access to credit . Borrowers who would otherwise have used a payday loan, had they been legal, turned to products such as lines of credit, installment loans, loans from religious institutions, and payment plans with creditors. Because of the high interest rates and predatory fees, researchers found that taking out payday loans actually made consumers more likely to have negative financial outcomes, like declaring bankruptcy.  In the absence of payday lenders, financial institutions like credit unions can fill the gap. Many credit unions, which are non-profits, offer payday alternative loans to their members. These loans function much like payday loans, but with interest rates that are much more reasonable. Removing bad actors like payday lenders creates more space for financial services like these to be successul in our communities.    What Can We Do?  The payday lending industry has deep pockets and strong connections to maany of the powerful people in this country.   "

How much interest would you have paid if you borrowed the money on a credit card which charged 18% instead?    You borrow $100 from a payday lender for 2 weeks, and they charge you a fee of $20 every two weeks until you pay off the loan. Assume that it takes you 3 months before you can pay off the loan. How much do you end up paying total? What is the equivalent annual percentage rate?    You borrow $100 from a payday lender for 2 weeks, and they charge you a fee of $20 every two weeks until you pay off the loan. Assume that it takes you 3 months before you can pay off the loan. How much money would you save if the loan charged 36% (APR) simple interest instead?    You borrow $500 and pay it back after 2 months. Calculate how much you would pay total in each of these scenarios. All interest rates are given as Annual Percentage Rates (APR) so be sure to use time in years!  You borrow the money from a friend who charges you 7% simple interest.  You put the purchase on a credit card that charges 21% compounded daily.  You put the purchase on a credit card that charges 21% compounded daily, plus a late fee of $10 for not paying the debt off after the first month.  You borrow the money from a payday lender that charges you a fee of $10 each week that you don't repay the loan.    How do the amounts compare in each situation? Explain why someone might choose to use a payday loan instead of a credit card or a personal loan from a friend.    The map in gives the payday lending rates in US states where predatory lending is still legal. Compute the total amount you would pay on a payday loan of $400 in Nevada, Indiana, and Ohio, if you paid it off after 6 months. How different are the amounts? Does the interest rate make a big difference in how much you pay?    Working as a class, use the map in to calculate the total amount you would pay on a payday loan of $400 in every state. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, the average payday borrower flips the loan 8 times, so we will use 18 weeks (the initial 2 weeks plus 8 more 2 week periods) for the borrowing time. Calculate the amount that the borrower would pay, using simple interest and the APR rates from to find how much the typical borrower would pay on the loan in each state where payday lending is still allowed.    A payday lender loans you $400, with a fee of $60 due when you pay the loan back in two weeks. If the lender believes there is a 5% chance that you will not pay back the loan at all, what is the expected value for the lender?    A payday lender loans you $300, with a fee of $35 due when you pay the loan back in two weeks. If the lender believes that there is a 2% chance that you will not pay back the loan at all, what is the expected value for the lender?    A payday lender charges $50 to loan you $400 for two weeks. Calculate the expected value for the lender if  There is a 2% chance you do not repay the loan at the end of two weeks.  There is a 5% chance you do not repay the loan at the end of two weeks.  There is a 10% chance you do not repay the loan at the end of two weeks.  There is a 15% chance you do not repay the loan at the end of two weeks.  Explain how lenders could use this information to decide if they should loan to a particular client.      According to the CFPB , 20% of the borrowers of payday loans eventually default. However, many of these borrowers make one or more payments before they default. Consider a $300 payday loan which charges a $40 fee every two weeks.  If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults without making any payments and an 80% chance that they repay the loan after two weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?  If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults after making one payment and an 80% chance that the borrower repays the loan after 4 weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?  If there is a 20% chance that the borrower defaults after making two payments and an 80% chance that the borrower repays the loan after 6 weeks, what is the expected value for the lender?  Explain how payday lenders could use this calculation to make money even when lenders have a high chance of default.  People generally default on loans because they are in severe financial distress. Research the consequences of defaulting on a loan - what effect can it have on a person's ability to borrow money, open bank accounts, get a job, or obtain housing? How long can these effects last?  Discuss the ethical ramifications of loaning money to someone with such a high likelihood of default, given the severe negative consequences of a default.      A payday lender loans you $300. Every two weeks that you do not pay off the loan, you own the lender $30. The lender believes there is a 10% chance that you will pay the loan off after two weeks, a 20% chance that you will pay the loan off after 4 weeks, a 30% chance you will pay the loan off after 6 weeks, a 30% chance that you will pay the loan off after 8 weeks, and a 10% chance that you will go 8 weeks and stop making payments ( defaulting on the loan). Complete the table below by computing how much money the lender makes in each scenario, and the chance of them making that much money. Remember to use a negative number if they lose money.    Event  Probability  Amount Lender Makes    Pays off in 2 weeks        Pays off in 4 weeks        Pays off in 6 weeks        Pays off in 8 weeks        Defaults after 8 weeks        Use your table to compute the expected value for the lender.    A lender in North Dakota loans you $400. Use the data in to determine how much you would pay if you paid the loan off after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, or 8 weeks. The table below gives the probabilities that the lender believes you will pay off the loan after a certain amount of time, or that you will default after 8 weeks of payments:    Event  Probability  Amount Lender Makes    Pays off in 2 weeks  0.05      Pays off in 4 weeks  0.15      Pays off in 6 weeks  0.30      Pays off in 8 weeks  0.20      Defaults after 8 weeks  0.30      Complete the table and use it to calculate the expected value for the lender. What is the expected value for the lender? Should they expect to make money off the loan?    You are applying for a loan from a bank that charges 8% interest, compounded monthly.  If you pay the loan off in one lump sum after 2 years, how much will you owe?  The bank believes, based on your credit score, that there is a 5% chance that you will not pay back the loan (called a default). Using your answer from the previous question, calculate the expected value of the loan for the bank.  Repeat the last problem, but this time assume that there is a 20% chance that you will not pay back the loan. What is the expected value for the bank now?  Repeat the previous question, but this time assume that the bank charges 15% interest. How much money do you owe after 2 years? What is the expected value for the bank if there is a 20% chance that you will not pay back the loan?  Do these calculations justify why the bank charges higher interest rates for some people than others? Explain why you gave your answer.      You borrow $800 from a payday lender to help cover your rent. The payday lender charges you $20 every two weeks until you pay off the loan.  How much do you pay the payday lender total if it takes you 2 years to pay off the loan?  What is the expected value for the lender, if there is a 5% chance that you don't pay the loan back after 2 years?  What is the expected value for the lender if there is a 20% chance that you don't pay the loan back after 2 years?  Explain why the lender can expect to make money on this loan, no matter how likely you are not to pay it back, as long as there is some chance that you will pay it back.      The file Alabama_Payday.csv contains the data we looked at in , but with two more columns - the population of each county and the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people in each county. In the chapter, we discussed the possibility that our correlation between payday lenders and larger Black populations might actually be a correlation between larger counties and larger Black populations, since we would expect larger counties to have more payday lenders. Computing a figure per 100,000 people in an area is a common way to compare statistics in areas of differing populations.  Calculate the correlation to see if larger counties do have more payday lenders. Then calculate the correlation between the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people and the percentage of each race in that county to see if there is still a correlation after we adjust for population. You can use the code window below, a spreadsheet program, or your calculator.     The file county-lender-data.csv contains data similar to what we looked at in the previous problem, but for every county in the United States of America (all data is from the 2021 County Business Patterns (CBP) and 2021 American Community Survey (ACS) of the US Census ). This file contains:  County Name  State Name  The number of payday lenders or similar businesses (more accurately, these are businesses classified as NAICS code 522390 , which includes check-cashing and money-wiring services, in addition to payday lending) in that county.  The population of the county.  The percentage of the county which is white.  The percentage of the county which is Black.  The percentage of the county who identify as Hispanic (note that as this is a cultural identity, individuals who identify as Hispanic can be white, Black, or neither).  The median household income in the county.  The percentage of people in the county over age 18 who have a high school diploma (or equivalent) or higher degree.  The number of payday lenders (NAICS code 522390) per 100,000 people in each county.    Choose a state to examine. Using the code window below, a calculator, or a spreadsheet program, calculate the correlation between the number of payday lenders and population, percentage white, percentage Black, percentage Hispanic, median income, and percentage of people with a high school diploma or equivalent. Which of these correlations are strongest for your state? Which are weakest? Explain what this tells you about where payday lenders are located.  Now repeat the exercise above, but use the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people. Which correlations are strongest for your state? Which are weakest? Explain what this tells you about where payday lenders are located. Why is this more useful than what you uncovered above?     The correlation values can be very different for different states. Repeat the work you did in , using the data from county-lender-data.csv and looking at the correlations between each variable and the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people, for the states of Missouri and New York. What is different about the correlations for these two states? Look at the data and do your own research on these two states - what might explain these very different correlations?    Working as a class, divide up the states and territories given in the file county-lender-data.csv . Calculate the correlations between each variable (percent white, percent Black, percent Hispanic, median income, percentage with high school diploma or higher) and the number of payday lenders per 100,000 people. Create a table as a class, using a shared spreadsheet or other document, with all of the correlations. What is the strongest correlation for each state? What is the weakest correlation? What patterns do you see in the correlations? Discuss the results as a class.    Using your results from , , and your own research, prepare a class letter to submit to your local government (city, county, or state) about payday lending. You should discuss how the calculations can help government officials to regulate payday lenders and understand the effect of these predatory lenders on communities.
