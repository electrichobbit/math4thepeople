		<title>A Note for Instructors</title>
		<p>
			Math for the People is designed to be used for an introductory college-level course in quantitative reasoning, with an emphasis on social justice.  Unlike a traditional mathematics textbook, the text is organized by social justice topics, with each module teaching the mathematics concepts needed to understand and work for change in a particular social justice area.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each module is designed to be independent, although there may be overlap.  Instructors are encouraged to proceed through the modules in the order that they find suitable, or to choose modules in consultation with their students.  Each module is designed to be completed in approximately two weeks of a standard 16-week semester, or one week of an 8-week quarter (6-8 class contact hours).
		</p>
		<p>
			Each module is structured identically, beginning with introductory material about the social justice topic and a discussion of the parameters of the problem being discussed.  Once students have a fundamental understanding of the topic, the module introduces them to mathematical skills which they can use to analyze the problem.  Finally, each module culminates in a section which encourages students to use their mathematical skills to engage with the social justice topic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because the topics which we are discussing in this class can be emotionally charged and "political," we encourage faculty to plan for this in advance.  The University of Waterloo offers a comprehensive set of <url href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/alternatives-lecturing/discussions/facilitating-effective-discussions"> tips for facilitating discussion of difficult topics</url> (Facilitating Effective Discussions. Centre for Teaching Excellence, University of Waterloo, <url href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-4.0</url>), some of which are summarized below:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Establish ground rules for discussion.  A suggested set of ground rules is provided in <xref ref="students-note" text="title"/>.  You can ask the class if they have other rules they would like to add.
			</li>
			<li>
				Encourage students to participate in multiple different ways, including verbal, written, and electronic participation. Some students may need more time to collect their thoughts for sharing.
			</li>
			<li>
				Actively work to include all students in the discussion. Don't allow one or two students to dominate the conversation or discourage contradiction.
			</li>
			<li>
				Group students and ask them to focus in one part of the issue and report back to the whole class.  Sharing ideas with a small group can be more comfortable initially.
			</li>
			<li>
				Be comfortable with silence. Long pauses are a natural part of discussion on difficult topics - if you fill the space too quickly, it can discourage active discussion.
			</li>
			<li>
				Limit your own involvement.  You can correct misinformation or enforce group rules, but the point of a discussion is to hear &amp; value student input.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<title>A Note for Students</title>
		<p>
			This textbook is intended to guide you through the mathematics necessary to understand and work to create change in a number of politically charged areas.  You may find areas where you disagree with the material presented or find that it challenges things you believe are true.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's ok.  Education, fundamentally, is about challenging what you already know and learning about new things.  You may find, through your research and work in this class, that your views don't change.  You may find that they do. Our goal, in Math for the People, is to present factual information and to teach you the quantitative tools you need to understand that information.  We encourage you to look at other data, work through your own examples, and see how it agrees or disagrees with what is presented in the text.  While we do not hesitate to present our own viewpoint, which we believe is supported by the quantitative data, these are complicated problems and there may be other solutions we're not considering.
		</p>
		<p>
			In working through these topics with your class, we encourage you to follow the following guidelines, plus any additional guidelines that your class agrees on (these guidelines are adapted from <xref ref="biblio-discussion-guidelines"/>):
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Listen to others, rather than just waiting for your chance to speak.
			</li>
			<li>
				Don't interrupt or talk over your classmates.
			</li>
			<li>
				Use "I" statements, like "I believe," "I think," "I feel."  There's a big difference between a statement like "I believe X is true" and "X is true."
			</li>
			<li>
				Support your arguments with evidence, especially with quantitative evidence.
			</li>
			<li>
				Give everyone the chance to speak. If you feel like you are monopolizing the discussion, take a step back and give someone else the chance to talk.
			</li>
			<li>
				Avoid personal attacks. You can disagree with someone's ideas without attacking that person.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not use language which is offensive or denigrates a particular group. Stereotypes and bigotry are inappropriate in the classroom.
			</li>
			<li>
				If someone does say something offensive unintentionally, give them space to learn from their mistake. You can share your discomfort with the instructor, who will help them understand why what they said was hurtful.
			</li>
			<li>
				Assume accountability for your words and actions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Share the lesson, not the story. Students may share personal information in class which should remain confidential.  You can talk about what you learned without sharing the personal details your classmate shared.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			We encourage every student who uses the textbook to fill out the <url href="https://forms.gle/WmE8DJ7Cc1DBiAz5A">Student Feedback Form</url>.  This information will help us improve the textbook for students who use it in the future.
