		<title>Understanding the Issue</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				In <m>2020</m>, Joseph Biden, Jr., said during his winning campaign for U.S. President that he would forgive <m>\$10,000</m> in debt for all those who had taken out student loans. In June <m>2021</m>, in the Education Department's largest student loan forgiveness action currently in effect, it eliminated <m>\$5.8</m> billion in debt owed by <m>560,000</m> former students of the now-defunct for-profit Corinthian Colleges system, which collapsed in <m>2015</m> amid federal investigations and lawsuits <xref ref="cowleyBillionLoansWill2022"/>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				One year later, on August <m>24</m>, <m>2022</m>, President Biden announced a plan that would forgive <m>\$10,000</m> for a subset of lower-income student debtors who had attended both for-profit and nonprofit colleges, then an additional <m>\$10,000</m> in student debt for an additional subset of highest-need borrowers. This plan was immediately controversial, quickly challenged by many Republican-led states, and unanimously blocked by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on November <m>14</m>, <m>2022</m> <xref ref="cowleyAppealsCourtBlocks2022"/>. This injunction preventing debt forgiveness from coming into effect was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments in February <m>2023</m> on the case. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, on January <m>10</m>, <m>2023</m>, President Biden proposed a novel income-based federal student loan repayment plan <xref ref="bernardWhatKnowBiden2023"/>. Why did President Biden feel the political impetus to forgive student loan debt? What were the political causes of and blowback to these debt forgiveness actions, and why were they so controversial? Whether or not Biden's loan forgiveness policy is overturned by the Supreme Court, what would its impacts be, and should future Presidents and legislators continue to advocate for student loan forgiveness?
			</p>
			<p>
				In this module, we begin by attempting to understand student loan debt through an analysis of media and political claims and the academic literature. Specifically, we ask:
				<ul>
					<li>
						What are the causes of the current level of student loan debt?
					</li>
					<li> 
						Who benefits from the high rate of student loan debt in the U.S.?
					</li>
					<li> 
						How does the load of student loan debt impact college students' and graduates' lives?
					</li>
					<li> 
						What factors, including time and the nonprofit status of a college, impact the burden of debt faced by students?
					</li>
					<li> 
						How do historical and present inequities, such as systemic racism, impact student loan debt load and default rates?
					</li>
					<li> 
						What is the federal government doing in response to the large amount of student loan debt in the U.S.?
					</li>
				</ul>

			The highest proportion of student loan debt (the amount of debt held per student) is held by students at for-profit colleges <xref ref="benmillerOpinionStudentDebt2018"/>, which are colleges that are not funded by taxes but instead depend on federal student aid (guaranteed by the government) and the tuition dollars that students pay to attend, often backed up by federal student aid. Contrast this situation with the vast majority of colleges and universities in the U.S., which are nonprofit institutions, which are usually run by a not-for-profit institution, religious organization, or government and hence often receive funding from taxes or a particular religious group.
		</p>
		<p>
			The greatest proportion of defaults (see <xref ref="student-loans-definition-default"/>) on student debt in <m>2015</m> occurred at the University of Phoenix, Walden University, Nova Southeastern University, Capella University, and Strayer University <xref ref="looneyCrisisStudentLoans2015"/>, of which all but Nova are for-profit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Almost all students are eligible to receive federal student loans, which are student loans funded by the U.S. federal government through programs such as Pell Grants. Federal loans are either subsidized (that is, interest payments are covered by the federal government for a period including the student's time at a college or university <xref ref="departmentofeducationSubsidizedUnsubsidizedLoans2023"/>; such loans are restricted to undergraduates only) or unsubsidized (in which case borrowers must pay the interest). 
		</p>
		<p>
			In contrast, private student loans are loans offered by non-governmental companies which are heavily advertised, do not offer the relatively generous forbearance and deferred-payment options that federal loans do, and charge interest while the borrower is in college. Often, private student loan interest rates are higher even than those of unsubsidized federal student loans. Since many students do not have a credit history, federal student loans do not require proof of, or a co-signer attesting, "creditworthiness", or evidence of past ability to repay debt; as of the <m>2010</m>s, most private student loans required such proof <xref ref="consumerfinancialprotectionbureauPrivateStudentLoans2012"/>. Additionally, students who declare bankruptcy are unable to discharge private student loans, meaning borrowers who have no money are still required to pay private corporations back for student loans <xref ref="ExceptionsDischarge"/>. Therefore, the U.S. government earns more income from student loans, but profits less, on average, than private student loan companies. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Employers benefit from the number of students who attend college, including those who could not otherwise attend without taking out student loans. "Credentialism", the continuing growth in employers' expectations of postsecondary education on the part of their employees, has been called a key driver of student loan debt <xref ref="furquimAnyOtherTrap2022"/>. In <m>2020</m>, earnings were stagnant for most workers, but declined rapidly for workers with no college education. This pressures people to seek a college education whether or not they can afford it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, a <m>2022</m> article in <en>The Atlantic</en> <xref ref="demsasWhoReallyBenefits"/> implies that middle-class college graduates were able to advance their cause over other causes championed by more marginalized groups because they have higher relative political power compared to non-college graduates. Certainly, as we will see below, middle-class college graduates benefit a great deal from President Biden's <m>2022</m> student debt cancellation policy.

		<title>Big Problem: the Staggering and Inequitable Burden of U.S. Student Debt</title>
		<definition xml:id="student-loans-definition-student-loans">
			<title>Student Loans</title>
			<p> 
				<term>Student loans</term> are a form of debt taken on in order to help students afford to pay tuition, fees, and other expenses necessary to attend colleges and universities. Unlike scholarships or grants, student loans must be repaid. 
			</p>
		</definition>
		<p>
			In July <m>2021</m>, student loan debt in the U.S. totaled <m>\$1.73</m> trillion. In <m>2019</m>, the average debt held by a student loan borrower was <m>\$30,000</m> <xref ref="nadwornyTheseArePeople2019"/>. 
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="student-loans-definition-default">
			<title>Default</title>
			<p>
				<term>Defaulting</term> on a loan means a borrower stops making the required payments on that loan. When someone defaults on a student loan, the federal government is allowed to withhold their tax refund, paycheck, or (for older adults) Social Security payments.
			</p>
		</definition>
		<p>
			The average person to default on their student loans owes less than <m>\$10,000</m>, suggesting that defaulters are make significantly lower incomes than the average student loan borrower. Those borrowers who did not complete a college degree are three times as likely to default as those who completed <xref ref="nadwornyTheseArePeople2019"/>. Moreover, half of Black borrowers who took out loans in <m>2003</m>-<m>2004</m> had defaulted after <m>12</m> years. 
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="student-loans-definition-pell-grant">
			<title>Pell Grant</title>
			<p>
				The <term>Pell Grant</term> is a federal government grant which provides money for college to low-income students that does not have to be repaid, unlike student loans. 
			</p>
		</definition>
		<p>
			Those who receive a Pell Grant, signaling they are low-income without adding to their debt, are still disproportionately likely to default on their student loans <xref ref="nadwornyTheseArePeople2019"/>.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="student-loans-definition-college-types">
			<title>For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Colleges</title>
			<p>
				All public and most private colleges (<m>91\%</m> of all colleges in <m>2016</m> <xref ref="theinstituteforcollegeaccess"/>) are <term>not-for-profit institutions</term>, meaning they invest their profits back into the institution and often operate under independent governance.
			</p>
			<p>
				A college that is not registered as a not-for-profit institution is called a <term>for-profit college</term>.
			</p>
		</definition>
		<definition xml:id="student-loans-definition-independent-governance">
			<title>Independent Governance</title>
			<p>
				A college or university operates under <term>independent governance</term> if their leadership is required to focus on factors other than generating a profit when providing an education <xref ref="theinstituteforcollegeaccess"/>. 
			</p>
		</definition>
		<p>
			A government study in <m>2017</m> found that the default rates for student borrowers at for-profit institutions, which are not required to focus on factors other than profit, were nearly double compared to community colleges; for-profit institutions have more expensive tuition and fees than community colleges, have lower graduation rates, and have less valuable credentials <xref ref="jenniehwooRepaymentStudentLoans2017"/>.
		</p>
		<definition xml:id="student-loans-definition-tuition">
			<title>Tuition</title>
			<p>
				Tuition is the amount of money charged by a college for instruction by faculty.
			</p>
		</definition>
		<definition xml:id="student-loans-definition-student-fees">
			<title>Student Fees</title>
			<p>
				A student fee is a sum of money charged to students at a school, college, or university in addition to tuition. Student fees may be used to support student organizations and activities, sports teams, exercise facilities, class supplies such as art materials, or anything else beyond the cost of instruction.
			</p>
		</definition>
		<p>
			The United States is a relative outlier compared to other nations in the high cost of college tuition and fees. For example, according to a late <m>2017</m> study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. has the highest average tuition costs of the <m>35</m> OECD member countries <xref ref="oecdEducationGlance20172017"/>. This tuition has increased over time.

Create an <term>expected frequency table</term> for what you'd expect to see if there were absolutely no racial differences in student debt. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Compute the difference between the observed count for each race <m>O</m> and the expected count <m>E</m>. What do you notice? 
					</li>
					<li>
						What if we averaged all the <m>O-E</m>\textquoteright s for each racial group? This is effectively the idea of a <term>chi-squared test for goodness-of-fit</term>, which is used by statisticians to determine whether any differences observed are small enough to be due to chance or large enough that they give evidence of a difference. What would the equation for this average look like? 
					</li>
					<li>
						We'll use a computer to perform this test in a minute. First, what groups do you think are disproportionately likely/unlikely to hold student loan debt? What racial groups have a higher/lower debt burden per person? 
					</li>
					<li>
						Now, enter this data into an app such as RStudio or an online tool. In RStudio, run this code to do a chi-squared test. (In a statistics class, walk through the steps.) Output the <m>p</m>-value (the likelihood the observed differences are due to chance alone) and \textbf{residuals}, which are basically scaled versions of the <m>O-E</m> s for each racial group. Which are highest? Lowest? Is there evidence of racial bias? 
					</li>

		<title>the Intersectional Inequities of Student Debt</title>
		<p>
			The average undergraduate student who takes out student loans has around <m>\$25,000</m> in debt by the end of their higher education, according to the U.S. Department of Education. However, this debt is not spread equitably by demographic category: <m>30\%</m> of non-Hispanic-identifying Black families carry an education loan, compared to <m>20\%</m> of non-Hispanic white families and <m>14\%</m> of Hispanic-identifying families <xref ref="koezeTollStudentDebt2022"/>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Student debt is also not equally spread among age groups; Millennials (who were <m>30</m>-<m>39</m> years old in <m>2021</m>) total over <m>\$500</m> billion in student loan debt, compared to a little over <m>\$350</m> million of Gen Z (under <m>30</m> in <m>2021</m>), a little under <m>\$350</m> million held by those <m>40</m>-<m>49</m> years of age in <m>2021</m>, a bit under <m>\$250</m> million held by those <m>50</m>-<m>59</m> years old, and only around <m>\$125</m> million held by those <m>60</m> or older in <m>2021</m> <xref ref="koezeTollStudentDebt2022"/>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since Black families have been prevented from amassing generational wealth through systemic racism (in which laws favor one racial group over another), the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, and mass incarceration, as well as continued implicit and explicit racism in public policy, housing (including the legacy of redlining, a policy which conitnued through <m>1977</m>), private banking and lending, access to education, and hiring practices, Black folks are both more likely to have to take on debt to attend college and less likely to attain wealth due to a college education <xref ref="geimanDisproportionatelyImpactedClosing2022"/>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In particular, a <m>2013</m> study found that the average white college-educated parent contributed <m>\$73,500</m> to their children's education, while Black parents contributed <m>\$16,000</m> on average. This is true despite the fact that, when controlling by household type and economic situation, Black parents contribute more on average than white parents.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lower-income Black parents are disproportionately likely to take out Parent PLUS loans, which is a loan provided by the U.S. Department of Education to the parents of college students. Parent PLUS loans are unsubsidized and charge a <em>loan fee</em> (added to each loan payment) of <m>4.228\%</m> and an interest rate of <m>7.54\%</m> as of <m>2022</m> <xref ref="departmentofeducationWhatParentLoan"/>, adding a substantial financial burden to the parent borrower. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Under these circumstances, Black borrowers default on student loans five times more often that white borrowers <xref ref="brownStudentLoansNot2022"/>. Therefore, the disproportionate load of student debt on Black borrowers is both a symptom of, and exacerbates, the racial wealth gap in the U.S., or the difference in total assets and debts between Black and white Americans.
		</p>
		<p>
			Defaulting on federal student loan debt leads to consequences such as bad credit ratings, a decrease in tax refunds, the garnishment of wages, and removal of security clearances which are at times a condition of employment <xref ref="brownStudentLoansNot2022"/>. The consequences for those who default include an inability to obtain loans to buy homes or cars, loss of wages, or loss of employment.

		<title>Solving for Change</title>
		<p>
			In August <m>2022</m>, President Biden committed to forgiving <m>\$10,000</m> in student debt for around <m>43</m> million debtors in the U.S., with an additional <m>\$10,000</m> being forgiven for Pell Grant recipients. The debt was forgiven only for single adults earning under <m>\$125,000</m> a year and married couples earning under <m>\$250,000</m> a year <xref ref="boseBidenSaysWill2022"/>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Student debt in the U.S. in <m>2022</m>, when President Biden proposed his student loan debt forgiveness plan, was roughly equal to the size of the economy of Brazil <xref ref="koezeTollStudentDebt2022"/>. Additionally, the amount of funding for higher education provided by state governments has declined from around <m>70\%</m> in the <m>1970</m>s to slightly under <m>60\%</m> in <m>2019</m> \cite{koezeTollStudentDebt2022"/>.
		</p>
		<p>
			An independent analysis by the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business found that about two-thirds of the financial benefit from Biden's student loan forgiveness plan will be to households making <m>\$88,000</m> or less per year, especially households earning between <m>\$51,000</m> and <m>\$82,000</m> a year <xref ref="pennwhartonbudgetmodelBidenStudentLoan2022"/>. The impact to the U.S. budget will be between <m>\$469</m> and <m>\$519</m> billion. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Wharton School also released the data in <xref ref="student-loans-table-debt-forgiven-by-income"/> on the distribution of student loan forgiveness benefits by income.

			<xref ref="student-loans-table-debt-forgiven-by-income"/> shows the distribution of student loan forgiveness benefit by income under the <m>2022</m> Biden student loan forgiveness plan. Most of the debt forgiven would have accumulated for those in the <m>25</m>-<m>35</m> age group; hence, this column may be more representative of the plan's effects. No benefit is expected to go to the top <m>5\%</m> of earners in either age group. Data from Wharton School of Business <xref ref="pennwhartonbudgetmodelBidenStudentLoan2022"/>.

			Assume for a moment that these policies stay constant for the next <m>10</m> years (perhaps an unlikely assumption given the changes in policy between Presidential administrations as well as Supreme Court challenges).
		</p> 
		<ol>
			<li>
				What percentage of the benefit will your age and income group receive <m>10</m> years from now?
			</li>
			<li>
				If you are in one of the groups (single adults earning under <m>\$125,000</m> a year and married couples earning under <m>\$250,000</m> a year, plus an additional <m>\$10,000</m> for Pell Grant recipients) that President Biden targeted for debt forgiveness in <m>2022</m>, what amount of debt will you have forgiven? 
			</li>
			<li>
				Do you believe that President Biden's student loan debt forgiveness policy is a good idea? Why or why not? Do its benefits for lower-income debtors outweigh its impats on the U.S. budget?

				<p>
					The following note from the Wharton Budget Model <xref ref="pennwhartonbudgetmodelBidenStudentLoan2022"/>, describes the income groups listed in <xref ref="student-loans-table-debt-forgiven-by-income"/>: "Estimate household income percentile thresholds for 2022 all age: 20%: $28,784; 40%: $50,795; 60%: $82,400; 80%: $141,096; 90% $212,209; 95%: $321,699; 99%: $961,711; 99.9%: $3,668,499."
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Given this information, estimate the percentage of the student loan forgiveness plan your income group will receive.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Congressional Budget Office <xref ref="virginiafoxxCostsSuspendingStudent"/>, a nonpartisan organization within the legislative branch of the United States government, estimated the total cost of Biden's student loan forgiveness program at <m>\$400</m> billion. Use this estimate, together with the information above, to estimate how much total debt relief (in U.S. dollars) your income and age group wlil receive <m>10</m> years from now.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					President Biden's loan forgiveness program involves an ``income cap'', which means that the program only applies to individuals who earn below <m>\$125,000</m> or households who earn below <m>\$250,000</m> each year. According to the Wharton analysis shown in Table <xref ref="pennwhartonbudgetmodelBidenStudentLoan2022"/>, whether or not an income cap is applied, the most loan forgiveness would go to households earning between <m>\$51,000</m> and <m>\$82,000</m> a year.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						What income percentile(s) in <xref ref="student-loans-table-debt-forgiven-by-income"/> do these earners belong to?
					</li>
					<li>
						Assuming that the loan forgiveness policy stays constant for the next <m>10</m> years, estimate the percentage of loan forgiveness that will apply to these income percentile(s). Make the simplifying assumption that all student loan borrowers are individuals and not households.
					</li>
					<li>
						Does the Wharton estimate make sense? Why or why not?

			<ol>
				<li>
					Decide what point the article is trying to make by citing these numbers. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Before pulling out an electronic device, brainstorm a list of questions (3-5) you'd like to know about the numbers--things that would help you understand if the numbers are big or small, and whether or not the underlying data actually supports the article's argument.
